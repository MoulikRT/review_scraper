However, it’s incredibly disappointing to see that Fiverr’s platform doesn’t seem to value or rank skilled professionals properly. Despite my positive reviews and strong client feedback, my gig still doesn’t appear among the top results. Meanwhile, many gigs that use copied images or misleading content are ranked above genuine creators like me. It’s frustrating to see that quality and authenticity are not being prioritized. On top of that, Fiverr’s commission structure is very high taking around 25%, compared to competitors like Upwork, which only charges 10%. This makes it harder for real professionals to sustain their business on this platform. Additionally, the customer support is painfully slow. I’ve applied for Freelancer Pro and Vetted Pro, and after submitting my applications, I sent follow-up emails as well. Yet, I’ve received no response at all. This lack of communication and support has only made me more disillusioned with the platform. Day by day, my confidence in Fiverr continues to decline, and I’m finding it harder to justify staying on the platform. Fiverr needs to improve its ranking algorithms to prioritize genuine talent, reduce commission fees, and actually support its top-tier freelancers. If these issues aren’t addressed soon, many dedicated professionals might start looking for alternative platforms where their work and commitment are truly valued.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=2","page_number":2},{"reviewer_name":"Milana","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6911808d3e4e0d7a91cd2d4e","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"MI","date":null,"star_rating":"1","review_text":"I've been trying to set up my seller account for over a week now, and I'm completely stuck in the phone verification loop. No matter what I do, I simply don't receive the SMS verification code needed to complete my account setup. I've tried multiple different phone numbers, thinking maybe it was an issue on my end, but the result is always the same - no SMS arrives. After several attempts, the system locks me out and tells me to wait 24 hours before trying again. This has been my reality for the past 7 days straight. What makes this even more frustrating is the customer support response. Every time I reach out, I get generic, cookie-cutter replies that don't address the actual technical issue. They seem to be copy-pasted responses rather than genuine attempts to resolve the problem. I'm eager to start offering my services on Fiverr, but I can't even get past the basic account verification stage. This is a critical failure in the onboarding process that's preventing willing sellers from joining the platform. Fiverr needs to either fix their SMS delivery system or provide alternative verification methods. Until this is resolved, I'm stuck on the sidelines, unable to access a platform I was excited to be part of. Update needed: Fiverr, please provide a working solution or alternative verification method for users experiencing SMS delivery issues.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=2","page_number":2},{"reviewer_name":"Angel Clarke","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/690dd4fc406414011635b224","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"AC","date":null,"star_rating":"3","review_text":"I have not a good experience.

Overall, I’ve had the pleasure of working with wonderful clients through Fiverr, and the platform has provided a solid, reliable space to connect and collaborate creatively.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=2","page_number":2},{"reviewer_name":"Henry","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/69109e07d1bf913079a44804","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/69109e07d1bf913079a44804/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"I have great experience with Fiverr.

I signed up, trusted the process, and immediately got contacted by someone claiming to “help” me complete my order. The person asked for my login credentials—something no real company should ever do. Shortly after, I got a security alert from Facebook saying someone (most likely connected to them) tried to access my account from a suspicious location—looked like Nigeria or somewhere similar. When I refused to hand over full access to my accounts, they suddenly stopped communicating, kept my $150, and never delivered any work. Their support was useless and did nothing to fix the issue or return my money. This company operates with zero accountability, full of fake “helpers” who pressure users into sharing private information. I feel robbed, misled, and unsafe after dealing with them.

As a beginner freelancer, I understand that I need to start by offering my gigs at low prices like $5 or $10 to attract clients, and that’s totally fine. But the issue I face is that whenever I create a new gig, I receive spam messages asking me to share my email so they can “send payment.” What?? I know these are scams, but beginners who don’t speak English well might think it’s a real client and fall for it. Fiverr already warns users not to share personal information, so I think it should also automatically detect and block these scam messages. It’s such a big platform something can definitely be done about this. Another thing is that the $400 earning requirement to reach Level 2 is quite high. If a freelancer consistently gets 5-star reviews on their first few orders, Fiverr could at least give them a small trust badge or some extra visibility something that shows buyers this freelancer is reliable.

However, in one case (Order #FO7284347ECC5), I experienced a seller who refused to complete the work—writing “I’m done with it”—and used dismissive language such as “Seriously? This is too much now!” Despite providing full documentation and screenshots to Fiverr Support, the seller faced no visible disciplinary action. Instead, I received an automatic account warning simply because my bank processed a chargeback after Fiverr had already closed my support ticket with no option to reopen it. My concern is not the policy itself, but the lack of equal enforcement. Buyers are penalized automatically, while sellers who violate Fiverr’s professional-conduct standards appear to face no consequence. I’ve repeatedly asked Fiverr’s Trust & Safety and Legal teams for acknowledgment, but have received only automated replies. I hope Fiverr reviews this case fairly, holds all parties to the same standard, and ensures that both clients and freelancers are treated with equal accountability.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=5","page_number":5},{"reviewer_name":"Andreas Reiza","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6909fd2e406414a3443095a7","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/6909fd2e406414a3443095a7/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=5","page_number":5},{"reviewer_name":"Erick Principal","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/67784837fd3a172dccbc96e0","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/67784837fd3a172dccbc96e0/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"Fiverr is the platform where God provides me with Jobs","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=5","page_number":5},{"reviewer_name":"Mubeen Majid","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6909f591ec11db1a861947c3","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/6909f591ec11db1a861947c3/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=5","page_number":5},{"reviewer_name":"waqar","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6909e208d1bf91632f9c24d3","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"WA","date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=5","page_number":5},{"reviewer_name":"Gray polly","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6909d99c40641406c2305149","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"GP","date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"Fiverr are trustworthy","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=5","page_number":5},{"reviewer_name":"Albert","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5ef652bea73550cbcb5faa06","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5ef652bea73550cbcb5faa06/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"1","review_text":"The Fiverr platform favors dishonest sellers over honest sellers.

My services required longer delivery times. I was punished simply because I needed more time to provide high-quality work. All my hard work, honesty, and loyalty became meaningless to Fiverr. They treated dedicated sellers like disposable tools. The Success Scores system is completely unclear and unfair. While my total average score across all gigs is 7, Fiverr displays it as 4 — and no one takes responsibility for this discrepancy.

It would be better if Fiverr could also consider the freelancer’s perspective more carefully. Sometimes, buyers take advantage — they get the complete work and then cancel the order, which badly affects new freelancers. Overall, Fiverr is an excellent platform — I would rate it 4.5 out of 5.

The platform now feels more like an automated chatbot experiment than a professional service marketplace. It’s painfully clear they’re trying to replace genuine human interaction with AI-driven chat systems and prewritten generic replies — even after hours of waiting for help. My latest experience today was a perfect example of how bad things have become. I simply tried to update my card details to pay a freelancer, but my account was unexpectedly logged out, and I received an email asking me to reset my password. Unfortunately, the number linked to my account was an old one, so I couldn’t verify or regain access. I then attempted to contact support — only to discover you can’t speak with them unless you’re logged in. Thankfully, I still had an old email thread from a previous issue, so I used that to reach out. After waiting several hours, I finally got a response... only to find it was a completely automated reply that ignored every detail I’d provided. I’ve contacted them again, but if this continues, I’ll simply move on. Thankfully, there are now plenty of Fiverr alternatives — Legiit, Freelancer, Upwork, PeoplePerHour, Guru, and many others — that still value real human support and actually help their users. If anyone human at Fiverr happens to read this, my ticket reference is #14022672.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=8","page_number":8},{"reviewer_name":"Smg Tech","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6901f77640641414c4286d72","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/6901f77640641414c4286d72/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"it's amazing working on fiverr","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=8","page_number":8},{"reviewer_name":"Kevin Gautheron","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/67b317611e09b49ebb15dc49","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/67b317611e09b49ebb15dc49/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"1","review_text":"I was charged twice even though the only service I used was canceled because the freelancer was useless.

Using this platform has been very convenient. However, I have two main gripes with it. Firstly, the amount of bots and scammers that message you. When you create a new gig, you'll be flooded with spammy DM's of bots & scammers trying to direct you to third party websites, or asking for your e-mail. Although Fiverr automatically protects you from some of these messages, many have gone unnoticed in my experience. Beyond that, my second biggest gripe with this platform is the price cut. 20% is, in my opinion, a hefty fee. I think 10% or 15% would be more fair.

I have never found a real job on Fiverr.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=13","page_number":13},{"reviewer_name":"Rush Mn","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68f7509cf647b75257691843","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/68f7509cf647b75257691843/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"Fiverr has been a great platform for connecting freelancers and clients from all over the world.

So far, I have successfully completed four orders. My initial experience has been largely positive. The platform is well-structured and makes it relatively straightforward to set up your \"Gigs\" and start attracting clients. The system is designed to build trust, and securing my first few orders felt like a great achievement. The payment protection for sellers is a key feature that gives me peace of mind, knowing I will get paid once the buyer approves the work. However, as a newcomer, the competition is undeniably fierce. It can be challenging to get noticed among thousands of other sellers. The 20% commission fee on each order is also quite significant, especially when you are just starting to build your income. While I understand it's for platform maintenance and client acquisition, it does cut into the profits. Despite the challenges, Fiverr has provided me with a valuable platform to launch my freelance career and gain practical experience. I recommend it to other new freelancers, but be prepared for patience and understand the fees involved. I plan to continue growing my presence here.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=13","page_number":13},{"reviewer_name":"Aleem ahmed","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68f5fc35f647b76006678aec","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/68f5fc35f647b76006678aec/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"ITS GREAT TO WORK HERE","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=13","page_number":13},{"reviewer_name":"Yaroslav Luchenko","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68f5e317abede21d08d809d4","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/68f5e317abede21d08d809d4/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"This work format is convenient, as there's no need to sift through hundreds of projects to find the ideal one for oneself.

Now occasionally i use them for one particular seller on their platform as I have worked with him for many years, my spend now would be only $200 a month at the most now. Fiverr now is now just about “padding” all jobs for the maximum cost to the buyer. Their game is just one big “funnel” of extracting every possible cent from buyers. They are always trying to “funnel” buyers into hourly rate job contracts and order all sorts of many \"extras\" and \"toppers\" like order revisions that should be within the job scope anyway. The website user experience is also woeful now, endless popups, self-playing annoying videos, time wasting AI chat bots in the message system plus the “ad farm” you need to swim through is just beyond terrible.

Originally the delivery time was agreed being 3-4 days but the freelancer asked for extension again and again. After he was not able to deliver what we agreed in the contract I told him we will give him a bad review for his service. As a result he asked to cancel the order - after he wasted already 10 days of our time for a time critical task. I denied and told him he need to deliver the agreed product. He involved Fiver support and ask them for cancelation. A few emails later and after explaining ou point of view (freelancer don´t want to face a negative feedback so he decided to run away from the job) and asking them to deliver a fair solution they canceled the order and our account at the same time. Means there is no support for the people who finance their platform and no approach to find a solution that is fair for all parties. Moreover they support the idea of unfair and unrealistic reviews as a client is never able to post a realistic experience if freelancers can always cancel if they do not like something. There are much better platforms out there which deliver a proper and honest customer feedback I highly suggest not to use somebody who is acting like that","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=15","page_number":15},{"reviewer_name":"We are MADA","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68f2155f87e69419932c3f4e","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"WA","date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"Fiverr helps us to drive sales for our business.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=15","page_number":15},{"reviewer_name":"Entreupia","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68f21430b411c1a190c79c17","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/68f21430b411c1a190c79c17/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"Great service, highly recommend it for freelancers looking for a platform to help them develop their career!","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=15","page_number":15},{"reviewer_name":"Mohsin ali Larik","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68f20bac8fb1d610f800bc0a","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/68f20bac8fb1d610f800bc0a/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"Fiverr is a good source of income for me.

This raises serious concerns about confidentiality and intellectual property protection on the platform. Unfortunately, Fiverr offers no real safeguards against developer infringement, and it appears there’s limited accountability when such issues arise. My legal team is currently addressing this matter, but I strongly recommend that anyone using Fiverr — especially for original or proprietary projects — proceed with extreme caution.

It’s just another company that makes money off your brain, your creativity, and your hard work. Fiverr exists to make them richer, not you. My experience with a few Fiverr sellers has been mixed, but generally excellent as some of them were truly talented, skilled people who delivered great work. But when you think about the time, communication, and revisions they go through for what they earn, you realise they’re also working for peanuts. As a seller myself, my last job took around an hour and a half including communication and revisions. I earned $12, which after Fiverr’s cut left me with about $8. That’s nothing for skilled work. Fiverr loves to promote “opportunity” and “freedom”, but for most new or genuinely honest sellers, it’s exploitation that is very well disguised as empowerment. This platform isn’t about fair pay. For me, it’s about volume and cheap labour that makes someone else wealthier and wealthier. If you have REAL skills, find another way to use them.

The work was results-based, meaning outcomes like sales, audience growth, and traffic take weeks or months to appear. The freelancer instructed me to accept each order quickly to move on to the next step, which prevented me from properly reviewing results within Fiverr’s 14-day refund window. This raises a serious concern: Fiverr allows freelancers to offer services that cannot realistically be reviewed within the platform’s refund or cancellation period. This effectively leaves buyers with no protection and forces them to accept orders they cannot verify. It feels misleading and gives customers no real choice, even when following the freelancer’s instructions in good faith. I paid a total of $1,113.75 to the freelancer, plus ongoing costs for Shopify ($25/month) and Facebook Ads ($140 every two weeks), and I received no measurable results. Fiverr Support reviewed my case multiple times but refused a refund, repeatedly citing their 14-day policy, even though the nature of this work makes it impossible to comply with that timeframe. This experience highlights a significant flaw in Fiverr’s buyer protection system and demonstrates how clients can be left vulnerable when results-based work is involved.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=20","page_number":20},{"reviewer_name":"Fawmi Rasmi","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/655c8f06b452130011fee7bb","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"FR","date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=20","page_number":20},{"reviewer_name":"Liaquat Ali","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68e38fb67e136911175e5aa1","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/68e38fb67e136911175e5aa1/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"It is a Good. thing for freelancer","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=20","page_number":20},{"reviewer_name":"Neo Singh dabi","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68e35e743603fe4b8064ee64","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/68e35e743603fe4b8064ee64/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"4","review_text":"The Clients were very good and the work i got was also excellent.

As a seller, you have little to no protection, and even when a buyer is clearly unfair or abusive, the system doesn’t allow you to defend yourself properly. There’s no real direct judgment between buyers and sellers buyers can leave damaging reviews without context, and sellers are left with no way to respond meaningfully. It's one-sided and demotivating for serious freelancers. Fiverr should take notes from platforms like Upwork, where both parties review each other and disputes are handled more professionally. Until Fiverr makes serious improvements in fairness and transparency, it’s hard to trust the system.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=21","page_number":21},{"reviewer_name":"Heath","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68b0220004313e1e2367aba0","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/68b0220004313e1e2367aba0/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"1","review_text":"I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding my experience with Fiverr and two of their freelancers. Despite Fiverr refunding my payments, the damage to my website and the time lost has been substantial, and Fiverr continues to allow these freelancers to remain active on their platform. Here is a timeline of what happened: 1. I hired a developer through Fiverr to connect memory functions for my AI project and fix website errors. While some errors were corrected, the memory integration was ignored. When I requested a refund, the freelancer attempted to pressure me into leaving a 5-star review in exchange for partial repayment. After refusing, and before I could revoke access, he logged into my website and deleted my chatbot along with critical pages. Fiverr refunded me, but I had to spend additional money and time repairing the damage. This freelancer is still active on their platform. 2. I then hired another Fiverr freelancer for the same project. He delayed communication for days, then falsely “delivered” a blank project. Fiverr refunded me again, but this freelancer remains active and later contacted me off-platform via WhatsApp to curse at me and make excuses. Fiverr support acknowledged the evidence I provided (including logs of website tampering) but ultimately told me that since I received refunds, “the case is closed.” I find it unacceptable that Fiverr knowingly allows freelancers who commit sabotage, dishonesty, and harassment to continue working on their platform. This is not simply a matter of refunds. It has cost me time, money, and credibility for my business. Fiverr’s failure to enforce accountability exposes consumers like me to ongoing harm. I am therefore requesting that consumer protection authorities review Fiverr’s practices regarding freelancer accountability and deceptive conduct. I also ask that this complaint be recorded publicly so that other small business owners and entrepreneurs are aware of the risks. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=21","page_number":21},{"reviewer_name":"VA","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68dc03598a838c80657f7b31","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"VA","date":null,"star_rating":"1","review_text":"As someone who values professionalism and transparency, I was very disappointed with my experience with “fiverr” just now.

He failed to deliver the full product as promised and kept delaying the project for weeks. When the product was finally \"delivered,\" it was incomplete. I immediately contacted Fiverr, but instead of offering clear guidance or stepping in, they told me to resolve the issue directly with the seller. At no point did they clearly inform me of their strict 14-day resolution policy — a critical piece of information they conveniently left out. Unsurprisingly, attempts to resolve things with Nadzir Studios went nowhere. The seller became completely unresponsive, and months later, I’m still left with an unfinished product and no resolution. To make matters worse, Fiverr is now refusing to provide a full refund, despite clear evidence of non-delivery and the seller's lack of communication. Their support has been dismissive and unhelpful. This experience has shown that Fiverr does not protect its buyers, even in cases of obvious fraud.

Concerns Regarding the Success Score System While I understand the value of having a performance metric like the Success Score to maintain quality standards on the platform, I believe the current system may have some inconsistencies or issues that need attention. Despite maintaining strong client satisfaction, timely deliveries, professional communication, and zero cancellations, my Success Score has been dropping without a clear explanation. This not only confuses but also creates unnecessary stress for freelancers who are doing everything right but are unable to understand where they are going wrong. I kindly request that Fiverr provide transparent and detailed insights into the criteria that influence the Success Score. If freelancers are expected to improve, they need to know exactly what factors affect their score and how they can take actionable steps to address them. Otherwise, showing a declining score with no guidance or control leaves sellers demotivated and in the dark. 2. Limited Opportunities for New Sellers Another critical concern is the lack of visibility and opportunities for new sellers on the platform. Many of us join Fiverr with the intention of working hard, building a career, and earning a stable income. Still, unfortunately, it has become increasingly difficult to get any traction as a new freelancer. New sellers are often not shown to clients, making it nearly impossible to receive orders organically. If they are expected to bring clients from outside Fiverr to the platform, then the value proposition of Fiverr diminishes, especially considering that Fiverr takes a commission, while some other platforms (like Upwork) do not charge for externally sourced clients. Additionally, the lack of features such as bidding on jobs or applying to postings, especially when such opportunities are only available to top-rated sellers, puts new freelancers at a severe disadvantage. If no one gives them a chance, how are they supposed to grow, earn, and eventually become top-rated themselves? Final Thoughts Fiverr has the potential to be a fair and empowering marketplace for freelancers at all levels. However, the current systems seem to disproportionately favor established sellers while making it extremely hard for new or growing freelancers to find their footing. My suggestions: Make the Success Score criteria transparent and actionable. Provide better visibility and chances for new sellers, especially those who demonstrate professionalism and quality. Consider fee flexibility for clients sourced externally. Introduce or expand job bidding features to give everyone a fair shot, not just top-rated sellers. I hope Fiverr takes this feedback constructively and makes improvements that support all freelancers, both new and experienced. Thank you for your time and for continuously working to improve the platform.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=24","page_number":24},{"reviewer_name":"Nasrinv Akter Sati","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68cfd6f58a838c619c73bca5","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"NA","date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"Great experience","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=24","page_number":24},{"reviewer_name":"Rana Fahad","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68cfc935412e4c04ab4d80b4","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"RF","date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"I am enjoying this field","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=24","page_number":24},{"reviewer_name":"Abundant Soul","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68cf959c3603fe29f2527da3","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/68cf959c3603fe29f2527da3/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"1","review_text":"No safety against fraudulent client chargebacks.

Instead of protecting me as a buyer, Fiverr repeatedly cited their 14-day cancellation policy — ignoring the fact that this was fraudulent behavior and an unfinished order, not a simple revision. Fiverr’s final response was essentially: “Too bad, the case is closed.” No refund, only a suggestion of a discount for a future order. This is unacceptable.

Unfortunately, my recent experience was anything but reassuring. The Problem After investing time and money into promoting Fiverr, I was successful in increasing traffic and conversions. But when it came to payment day, my account suddenly had issues: Continuously asking for traffic verification, even when I provided full proof. No clear response or follow-up from the support team. Weeks of silence, disrupting my financial plans. Feeling “Cheated” When you get results but a platform remains silent about payment, you will definitely feel like your efforts are being overlooked.

Respect the work of affiliates who bring revenue to your platform. Maintain the trust that built your reputation in the first place. Lessons Learned for Other Affiliate Partners If you plan to partner with a Fiverr Affiliate, keep detailed records of all traffic, screenshots, and communications. Transparency is key, but protecting yourself in the event of a payment delay is equally important. I was extremely disappointed with the way my payment was handled recently. The team had previously confirmed my payment. However, due to an error with my PayPal account, I submitted a request to change to a different PayPal address. The following month, I received a notification that Fiverr’s system was “indicating high traffic to the live site,” and Fiverr was rejecting the payment for that reason.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=24","page_number":24},{"reviewer_name":"Carole A.","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/667423fdf6dae61719417936","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/667423fdf6dae61719417936/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"3","review_text":"useful but too many non professional freelancers (late, disrespectful etc)","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=24","page_number":24},{"reviewer_name":"Mia","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6362a510608f2c001313e966","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"MI","date":null,"star_rating":"1","review_text":"I’ve used Fiverr several times. In certain cases, for small, non-critical tasks, it can be “good enough.” But from my experience (and many others), Fiverr isn’t reliable if you need something professionally done with high standards. What I found: the quality fluctuates a lot — even among “Pro” freelancers with high ratings. I once ordered from a vetted European freelancer with almost perfect reviews; the delivery was more than twice the promised time, and the outcome was disappointing. The “premium” price and promises didn’t match the result. In my case, this wasn’t just an inconvenience, it was a costly mistake. I paid around $1,500 for a brand kit that arrived late and in poor shape. Because of that, I went unprepared to an important fair, which was both stressful and damaging. The whole project ended up wasted time and money. Deadlines are another recurring issue. Freelancers often ask for extensions; occasionally legit reasons (personal issues, etc.), but that doesn’t change the fact that you, the client, are left to absorb the impact. Communication is inconsistent, and cancellations/refunds are a hassle. It’s a pity, because the attention I received in the chat has always been proactive and gave me the feeling that customer service was great. But when it comes to refunds, it turns into a pain. I wasted too much time dealing with unprofessional freelancers, and I simply won’t order again. Overall: Fiverr works if you have flexibility with time, moderate expectations, and are okay with taking risks. But if you need dependability, polished work, and a professional image to protect, you’re better off with specialized freelancers or agencies, even if they cost more. Definitely not for me.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=24","page_number":24},{"reviewer_name":"Talentedfunnel","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68cbdb867e1369000b4844aa","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"TA","date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=24","page_number":24},{"reviewer_name":"nida tariq","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/656f80a0392ecb00125f813b","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/656f80a0392ecb00125f813b/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"Smooth experience and very convenient for hiring and working.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=24","page_number":24},{"reviewer_name":"financela agency","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68cbd86d7b741c372c999c0d","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/68cbd86d7b741c372c999c0d/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"everything i just perfect literally, i wish they could just lower their fees a bit, but all is good. all love","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=24","page_number":24},{"reviewer_name":"Soner Harmandar","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/67b4b72e1e09b48cc317ebfb","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/67b4b72e1e09b48cc317ebfb/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"1","review_text":"I have had a terrible experience with Fiverr Customer Support. Let me explain it: One customer asked me to fix the rig of the character. He said the character of the feet needs to be fixed while animating. I edited the rig and sent a screenshot of it even before the order. He saw the screenshot and said \"It looks okay, we can continue.\". After the order was created, he suddenly changed his mind and said, \"We are going to just get some new models made. Sorry for the inconvenience\". The character wasn't even created by me, so I have no fault and don't want to cancel the order naturally, and I have always tried to solve the issue. BUT Fiverr Customer Service cancelled the order even though I spent all my time and a lot of effort on it. What did I get in return? Zero dollar + damaged success score + downgraded Fiverr profile rating + wasting my time, effort + A 1-star review on my profile with a fake slander, and he even says to me a scammer??? Fiverr customer service trashed all my effort, time, plus the negative impact occurred on my gig profile because he said, \"this seller is a SCAMMER. DO NOT WORK WITH HIM\". This is also a wrong review, he said on the review, \"he told he couldn't fix it.\"(I never said I couldn't fix it) and \"he couldn't answer due to the job not officially starting\"(I always responded to him and even I completed the work before ordering to get the client :( ) They didn't even happen, he slandered, and there is nothing I can do.. but he wrote these and will impact my future orders... All my effort, time(even while writing to customer service and here), money, reputation, Fiverr profile rating, and success score are wasted. I am still waiting for the customer service. I don't think anything will be fixed because they created this mistake chain, but I'm still waiting.

Unfortunately, the delivered work was completely inadequate and non-functional. **Specific Technical Failures:** - **First attempt:** Components overlapped on the PCB layout - a basic design error that would make the board impossible to manufacture - **Second attempt:** While the report looked more professional, the seller admitted the design \"does not support direct driving of 2× 2.5A DC motors at 7.2V\" - exactly what I paid for - **Missing critical components:** No proper motor driver stage (H-bridge or power MOSFETs) - **Inadequate power handling:** PCB traces too narrow for required 5A current (2×2.5A motors) - **Poor design practices:** Missing bulk capacitors, insufficient decoupling, improper power routing **The seller's own technical report concluded:** - Current design cannot handle the specified motor loads - \"A separate high-current motor driver board is necessary\" - Multiple fundamental design flaws throughout **Communication Issues:** After resolution center involvement, seller made superficial modifications without addressing core problems. Final delivery was essentially an admission that the original requirements could not be met with their design. **Bottom Line:** Paid for a working 2.5A motor controller upgrade, received a non-functional design that requires additional hardware to work. Complete waste of time and money. **Warning to buyers:** Verify seller's actual PCB design experience before hiring - this seller lacks fundamental knowledge of motor control circuits.\" This review uses the technical evidence to show exactly why the work failed, making it credible and helpful for other potential buyers.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=25","page_number":25},{"reviewer_name":"Enioluwatilehin","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68caf470412e4c2615493c79","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/68caf470412e4c2615493c79/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"1","review_text":"I have been a Level 1 seller on Fiverr, and my account was recently suddenly disabled, flagged, and my Level 1 status removed, all without any clear explanation.

Between paying to promote gigs and Fiverr taking a 20% commission on any potential order, it feels like I’m working just to feed the platform - not to grow my business. On top of that, scammers are everywhere. I’m constantly approached by fake buyers or shady profiles trying to get free work or phish information. It’s gotten to the point where it’s hard to tell who’s a genuine client and who’s a scammer. And Fiverr doesn’t seem to have an effective system in place to filter or protect sellers from these bad actors. The combination of spending money with no return, being bombarded by scammers, and Fiverr’s high commission structure is honestly exhausting. Right now, it feels like I’m working for Fiverr, not for myself. Unless things improve - more transparency, better protections for sellers, and fairer ad systems - I’ll be seriously considering leaving the platform.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=26","page_number":26},{"reviewer_name":"Luke P","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5e87691b4d2b562c8abeb6aa","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"LP","date":null,"star_rating":"2","review_text":"Very disappointing that I cannot make an account for 12 months just because I had to delete my account because the user interface wouldn’t let me continue to make an accounts","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=26","page_number":26},{"reviewer_name":"Ahmet Can Koc","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/676ff2790343f7933dd7aa4d","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/676ff2790343f7933dd7aa4d/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"1","review_text":"I had a client with whom I worked regularly for about a year. Together we completed many projects, both small and large. 10 months ago, this client canceled 6 completed orders through their bank, even though those orders had been fully delivered and 2-3 months had already passed since completion. At that moment, $800 was taken from my Fiverr balance and refunded to the client. This is similar to returning a product months after using it, something completely beyond the seller’s control. Fiverr identified this behavior as fraud and banned the client’s account. However, as a result, my Success Score was significantly reduced. In other words, not only did I lose my earnings, but my performance rating was also penalized. It has now been 10 months since the incident. During this time, I have worked with 8 new clients, and every order was completed with 5-star ratings and tips. Yet my Success Score has continued to decline, and it is now down to 4. As far as I know, negative impacts are supposed to decrease after 60-90 days. But the fact that my score is still low suggests that this may be a system error. Orders canceled due to fraud should not affect the Success Score, or at the very least, their impact should be removed retroactively. Considering that I have successfully completed 18 orders with 5-star ratings and tips, having a Success Score of 4 does not align with a fair system that is supposed to motivate sellers. I truly hope this issue will be reviewed and that a solution will be provided to better protect the efforts of sellers.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=26","page_number":26},{"reviewer_name":"Aditya Naikwadi","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68c6c154412e4c1c6e4451b7","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/68c6c154412e4c1c6e4451b7/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"3","review_text":"some clients are so rude and not give any rating and review even if i gave them proper treatment.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=26","page_number":26},{"reviewer_name":"MD.

These buyers used fake payment forms and asked for my email address in classic scams. Instead of protecting new sellers, Fiverr shut my account down without a proper explanation. I did not break Fiverr’s Terms of Service and take them seriously. It is unfair that honest sellers are punished while scam accounts continue to operate freely. What Fiverr needs is accountability: protect sellers from fraudulent buyers, be transparent about suspension decisions, and create a safer marketplace. Right now, it feels like sellers are left vulnerable while scammers are running the platform. Update: After a few messages to support, Fiverr restored my account. While I am grateful for this solution the initial issue was very worrying and disheartening and resulted in my losing trust in the platform. I hope this issue can be better handled for new service providers going forward. Reply from Fiverr Hi there, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

I’m disgusted, angry, and fed up with how Fiverr manipulates its own Terms of Service and keeps changing the rules as it suits them — while freelancers like me suffer in silence. Let me tell you my story. I joined Fiverr last year to build a freelancing career. I worked hard, delivered value, made money — until Fiverr suddenly flagged and disabled my account in August without warning. After months of silence, the account was reopened in November. I added my payout method — first tried Payoneer, then added PayPal when Payoneer didn’t work. Within 24 hours of adding my payout method, Fiverr disabled my ability to withdraw funds. When I contacted support, I was met with the vague excuse of “suspicious activity” on my account — and that, because of this, my withdrawals would be permanently disabled. Since November, I have been fighting this injustice, opening over 50 support tickets, and the result? Nothing but conflicting responses from different agents and even supervisors. Some promised to resolve it. Some said the withdrawal would be enabled. Others told me bluntly to forget it — that I’d never access my money again. To this day, no one has answered my two very simple questions: If I can’t access my money, who does it belong to? Will the buyers be refunded, or does Fiverr get to keep my hard-earned money? No one is answering. No one is helping. They keep hiding behind a curtain of “we can’t provide that information right now.” That’s not just unprofessional — it’s theft. The justification? That I violated Fiverr’s TOS. I’ve read that TOS, and here's the truth: The version active at the time (September 2024) only permits temporary suspension of withdrawals for suspicious activity — not permanent. Nowhere does it say Fiverr can seize my funds indefinitely. To make matters worse — and this is what truly shattered me — I reached out to Fiverr support begging for access to my money because I was sick and in urgent need of medical help. I explained this was a desperate time for me and my family. Fiverr’s response? Cold. Robotic. Heartless. No sympathy, no humanity — just silence. It’s like they’re waiting for me to give up or die so they can quietly pocket what doesn’t belong to them. Let’s be honest — I could have taken my buyer off the platform and gotten paid directly. But I didn’t. I respected Fiverr’s rules. I played fair. And this is how I’m being repaid? Other platforms like Upwork would have at least refunded the client if my account was disabled. Fiverr? They’ve refused to refund the client, refused to pay me, and refused to explain where the money is going. You take your 20% cut — fine. But how dare you then withhold the remaining 80% that I worked for? How dare you profit off my effort and then shut me out? This is not just a dispute. This is a betrayal. My demand is simple: Give. Me. My. Money. Is that too much to ask? The fund in question is $1832 Your ticket: (#13857879) Reply from Fiverr Hi Zenith, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

My only recourse now is to file a formal complaint with the Consumer Court. I was hired for a complex, custom $500 project with very specific requirements. After I had completed the bulk of the work, the buyer made false claims to Customer Support to get a refund. I immediately provided Fiverr's support team with a mountain of clear, dated, and undeniable evidence—including screenshots and detailed renders—proving that I had fulfilled every single one of the buyer's requirements. Despite this mountain of proof, Fiverr's support team chose to ignore the facts. They sided with the buyer's unsubstantiated claims, wrongfully cancelled my order before I could even make the final delivery, and effectively allowed my work to be stolen. But it gets worse. After I escalated this publicly, their \"relevant team\" investigated and sent their final decision. Their justification for withholding my payment was a blatant, provable lie. They claimed in an official email that I had violated their policies by sending \"multiple delivery messages without any files in them.\" This claim is a complete fabrication. I have a screenshot of their own order page showing no deliveries being made because their team's cancellation made it impossible for me to deliver. They lied about my actions to justify their own mistake. This experience shows that your evidence, no matter how clear, may be ignored. Worse, their support team may resort to inventing false claims to cover their errors. The 20% commission you pay for \"security\" is meaningless when faced with a support system this broken and dishonest. Do not trust this platform with any significant project. They have left me no choice but to seek justice outside of the Fiverr support system. There's no 'support' in their customer support. Only disregard, lies and manipulation. They will do ANYTHING to avoid paying out.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=30","page_number":30},{"reviewer_name":"ABDUL Mouiz","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68b95ecaa02fb30813f8ea0d","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/68b95ecaa02fb30813f8ea0d/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"best marketing platform, but they not push new service provider","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=30","page_number":30},{"reviewer_name":"zary .s","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68b9583e11121e4153669e0a","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/68b9583e11121e4153669e0a/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"I like how it handles the keywords and how it takes quick action against fraud and false people.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=30","page_number":30},{"reviewer_name":"Israfil Rabby","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68b955a5cc7c9430b550f445","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/68b955a5cc7c9430b550f445/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"Really a place for freelancer who wants regular freelance work, no worries with the payment as long as everything in rules","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=30","page_number":30},{"reviewer_name":"Abdal","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/68b90cb7cc7c94d12f50b246","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/68b90cb7cc7c94d12f50b246/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"1","review_text":"I have been working on Fiverr for years, always delivering my projects on time with good reviews. Recently, I completed an order, delivered everything as promised, and the buyer even left me a 5-star review. However, after that, the order was suddenly canceled due to a chargeback from the client’s side. This means the buyer got to keep my completed work AND also got their money back. Fiverr’s system automatically reversed the funds, leaving my balance in negative, even though I upheld my part of the agreement and delivered what was required. When I contacted support, they responded with vague messages such as “continue doing good work” and claimed there was nothing they can do about the chargeback. In other words, Fiverr places all the financial risk on the freelancer, while the client can exploit the system and walk away with both the work and the refund. This is not only unfair, but also discouraging for sellers who spend hours or even days on projects. Fiverr markets itself as a platform that supports freelancers, but in reality, they don’t protect sellers against chargeback fraud. I am extremely disappointed, as this situation has left me demotivated and questioning whether Fiverr is a safe platform for honest freelancers.

They said that my account was suspended and would be deleted in 60 days with little to no explanation. I have emailed back and forward and they have said that the decision is \"final\" without giving me an explanation beyond \"you do have more than 1 account with us, or have accounts that have been disabled for violating our guidelines.\" I certainly only have 1 account with fiverr as i had to submit my ID to be verified and am not sure what the violating of guidelines are they are reffering too. No warning. No flagging. just cut off. I have been servicing these clients for many years and have projects in the middle of the works for my own clients and am now unable to communicate with the people i buy from and cannot communicate with previous clients!

The variety of services is impressive — from design and writing to coding and marketing, there’s almost everything you can think of. Prices are usually fair, and you can often find good deals for quality work. Most of my experiences have been positive, with talented freelancers delivering exactly what I needed. However, quality can vary a lot depending on the seller, so you really need to check reviews and portfolios before ordering. Customer support is decent but sometimes slow to respond. Overall, Fiverr is a great place for quick and affordable freelancing solutions. Not perfect, but definitely worth using.

Throughout these years, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects for clients from around the globe, and everything was going smoothly until the end of 2023. However, with the arrival of 2024, Fiverr introduced new rules and regulations, along with updates that have significantly impacted sellers and buyers alike. Compared to last year, things have taken a downturn. There’s been a noticeable decline in job opportunities, with fewer impressions and clicks than in 2023. Despite being active, I've faced almost no projects this year. It’s frustrating, especially since I've been \"Fiverr's Choice\" for over three months now, yet I haven't received a single job from that gig, even though I have 11 positive five-star reviews and 16 projects completed. I held onto the hope that Fiverr would turn things around, allowing me to secure some projects and earn a bit of money, believing that 2025 would be my year. Unfortunately, it has been even worse—I haven't landed a SINGLE project in the past nine months, and I doubt I will this year either. All the money I invested in internet resources has gone to waste. Given my experience, I can't recommend Fiverr at all. Thank you.

I hired a colorist with hundreds of good reviews. Instead, he sent me an additional payment request for something I had already paid for. Pressed for time, I mistakenly approved it. When I pointed this out, he ignored my message and kept the money. To me, this felt like a deliberate trap rather than an honest mistake. Also he delivered a poor job that looked like nothing more than a preset. Even Fiverr’s Resolution Center stated that this looked like an attempted scam. Good: Fiverr refunded everything and even gave me a discount for future orders. One of the best and fastest after-sales services I’ve ever received. Bad: Because the order was canceled, I cannot leave a review. The freelancer’s profile stays online with glowing reviews, free to keep deceiving more buyers. Conclusion: Fiverr’s support is outstanding, but the platform itself admits that some sellers are acting like scammers while still keeping their profiles active.

Earlier today, I signed up for Fiverr and created a music production gig. A user messaged me saying they were interested and that a “Fiverr agent” would reach out to verify my account/payment method — sounded kinda odd, but I was still new and trying to follow the steps. Then this so-called \"agent\" contacted me inside Fiverr's messaging system, trying to walk me through some weird “instant verification” by charging the full amount on my card (in my case: €3,527.42 — I kid you not) to a company named SHA2 Solutions. He kept insisting it would be “frozen just for 5 seconds” and then reversed. Obviously, that was my breaking point. 🚨 He kept calling me \"young man\" and tried to sound reassuring — but the whole thing reeked of scam. I told him I wasn’t comfortable, and he replied “you’ve already given consent, we can’t cancel now,” to which I replied “yes we can cancel.” I immediately deactivated my Fiverr account and contacted support. Turns out the user was NOT a Fiverr agent, just a scammer trying to phish via Fiverr inbox. Thankfully, Fiverr support was fast and confirmed: — No financial info was stored — The scammer’s account was removed — Fiverr does not ever ask for payments or verification via inbox So, long story short: ✅ Don’t give verification codes to anyone in chat ✅ If anything smells weird — trust your gut ✅ Fiverr will never ask for card charges via message ✅ Always report and block suspicious users ✅ And maybe... stick to safer platforms until you’re sure Stay safe out there. Hope this saves someone the headache. Reply from Fiverr Hello Petros, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We're sorry to hear about your experience. We'll never send you a link or QR code asking for payment info via the inbox.

He purchased a moderate package but kept requesting premium-level service, assuring me that he would upgrade later. Trusting his word, I delivered work at a premium standard. However, he never upgraded and ultimately accepted the delivery under the moderate package, leaving me uncompensated for the additional effort and value I provided. This behavior feels dishonest and exploitative. For improvement, clients should clearly choose the correct package that matches their expectations instead of promising upgrades they never follow through on.

Real profiles with real photographs of validated, competent people, at competitive rates. I just went back looking for a service and had to navigate through dozens of shady profiles. Most of them had 5-stars or near, with very non-descript reviews (fake?). They had what looked like AI generated profile pictures of attractive people, sometimes the same photograph for 4 or 5 distinct profiles. I finally found one profile that seemed more credible and purchased a small gig from her. The first thing she did was to try to bait and switch me to spending more on the gig. When I declined, she became unresponsive and I ended up canceling the gig. I suspect that the profile was not an legitimate one. I do, however, recognize that Fiverr refunded my money instantly. The company has been legitimate for many years but it looks like it is now poorly managed these days and got ran over with fake profiles from all over the world.

The person working on the project, does a great job and I want to TIP them for the work, I get charged a separate fee for just the TIP. Initially Fiverr doesn't bill you until the project is complete after we accept it and it will direct you through the TIP page and then add a separate fee for that, WHY? if the payment process hasn't gone through, why are we getting charged a full FEE again? I would love to TIP someone for a good job done, but YOU are discouraging buyers from doing so with this SCAM you got going. Not happy about that and it is NOT fair for the seller and buyer.

I’m a level 2 seller with more then 150 orders completed on the platform (success score 9) Lately I’ve been having problems with this platforms customer support (AI bots basically) which cancel orders as soon as the customer complaints without even asking for the sellers side of the story. Yesterday I had an order canceled (which was accepted since the 3rd of August) 21 days after being marked as completed, cause 15 days after the order completion the customer decided a revision was needed, I refused since the work order was completed and I’m not obligated to give a free revision but for my surprise I got the order cancelled and funds taken back from my account. I contacted with customer support and they’re on the customer side even though this whole situation makes no sense.

After 5 months, all I received was a simple responsive website with login — nothing close to the agreed scope. I filed multiple refund requests, but the seller declined every one. Fiverr Support told me to give the seller “24 hours” to finish the order — but after 5 months, it’s obvious the seller is unskilled and cannot deliver. ⚠️ This is misrepresentation and breach of trust. Fiverr has not protected me as a buyer, even for a high-value $9,500 project. Buyers beware: Fiverr’s Buyer Protection is unreliable for serious investments.

Despite Fiverr’s own Terms of Service, which clearly state that orders cannot be cancelled based on “quality of delivery,” Fiverr still cancelled the order and returned the full funds to the buyer. In other words, the buyer walked away with my work for free. This experience makes it very clear that Fiverr prioritizes buyers at the expense of sellers, disregarding the time, skill, and effort we invest. The message is simple: a client can exploit your work and Fiverr will not protect you. Fiverr has shown itself to be less a fair marketplace and more a sweatshop model where sellers’ well-being is disregarded. If you are a freelancer who values your time and professionalism, I strongly advise thinking twice before relying on Fiverr as a secure platform.

While Fiverr has potential, there are some major issues that need attention. First, the fees feel really high about 30%-35% of the order price goes to Fiverr/Banks/Paypall which seems excessive. On top of that, the platform is filled with scammers who try to pass off fake AI-generated work as original and professional, while undercutting real sellers. This makes it hard to trust the marketplace and hurts both buyers and genuine freelancers. Another issue is the order chat system. Many times, when I click on an order notification to open the chat, the platform becomes unresponsive, which makes communication frustrating. There also needs to be a way to adjust the order price during the process if extra work or changes come up, instead of having to cancel and redo everything. Overall, the platform works, but these problems take away from the experience. Fixing the scammer issue, improving chat responsiveness, and giving sellers and buyers more flexibility with order pricing would go a long way in making Fiverr better.

Fiverr backed him. 7th order (Elena): She THANKED me for the work, then opened a dispute filled with lies. Fiverr still canceled.

The biggest scam here is the dispute system. A buyer can take the full service from a seller and then, without giving any valid reason, simply open a dispute. Fiverr immediately sides with the buyer, leaving the seller with no support or protection. This is not an isolated case —it happens again and again. Many buyers misuse this loophole to get free work, and Fiverr allows it to continue unchecked. Instead of protecting hardworking sellers, the fiverr encourages fraud and makes sellers feel cheated. This behavior is extremely unfair, unprofessional, and damaging to the marketplace. Fiverr must realize that without sellers, the platform cannot exist. Sadly, at this point, Fiverr looks less like a trusted marketplace and more like a scam company. Reply from Fiverr Hello James, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

The site is overrun with scammers and bots, so you waste hours dealing with fake clients and suspicious messages. If you finally get a real gig, the buyer can cancel or demand extra work for free, and Fiverr always sides with them even if they break the rules. The “Success Score” will plummet after one single bad review and never recover—ten five-star ratings don’t matter. Customer support is useless: you get copy-paste bot replies, and getting a human is impossible. They suspend your account for no reason, sometimes after years of work, and appeals just get ignored or closed. Sellers are treated like garbage, blamed for everything, and have no protection from bad buyers or Fiverr’s own buggy AI. Even payments are a hassle: they took away PayPal, refuse refunds, and sometimes ban you for reporting scams. The commission is insanely high (20%) for this trash service. Avoid Fiverr at all costs if you value your sanity. It’s unfair, full of bugs, loaded with fraud, and the support team couldn’t care less. You risk losing months or years of hard work for nothing.

We will be sure to share your feedback on ways we can enhance the success score metric, as well as our ratings, reviews, and feedback feature.When it comes to how it works, the success score metric evaluates each of your Gigs in key areas related to the order process and your relationship with clients, with the history of each Gig examined to determine a score, relative to other freelancers.

When opening the account, I was told that I could receive my payments through PayPal, which is great because it’s hard to trust the internet with your bank account. After posting my first gig, I got some clients. When I received the emails, I was told I had to click a link to accept the job or whatever. I clicked the link in my email inbox and instantly I was redirected to some page with “Fiverr” at the top, but it’s asking for my bank information. I knew something was suspicious because my payment info is already saved in my account. As well as the fact that I hadn’t even completed the order yet, so I can’t really get payed until I complete it. And also because when I first clicked the link, Google chrome recognized the site as unreliable and dangerous. I had to open fiverr on safari to be able to see where the link would take me. When I got to the redirected page, a chat with one of the fiverr agents appeared on the bottom right of my screen. I told the agent that I would rather the money be deposited into my PayPal which is linked to my fiverr account. He instantly got sassy with me, said that they don’t use PayPal anymore on Fiverr because of previous fraudulent transactions that occurred or whatever. I felt some judgment from his part when he was like “do you not have a bank account?” and I said that I’d rather use PayPal because it’s safer. He said that he was going to be permanently suspending my Fiverr account until I give him my bank information. After he suspended my account, I sent an email to fiverr’s support team to figure out what was going on. And they told me that they suspended my account because I was apparently trying to sell things to clients outside of Fiverr and speaking to clients about things that have nothing to do with gigs. Which is completely not true. When I responded back to their reply, they did not answer. I don’t know if they will end up answering later or not, but the unprofessionalism makes me not want to work with them anymore anyways.

For example, in my own case, I contacted Fiverr support to stop a buyer from cancelling an order after he already received all the work. The buyer had nothing else to share, no revision requests, and he still sent a cancellation request — and Fiverr is allowing it! Other problems: When someone forgets their phone number, Fiverr refuses to let them change it. The verification process is extremely frustrating. Many buyers collect the finished work and use it, then cancel the order. Fiverr blocks or flags seller accounts even when they haven't done anything wrong.

I have been working on Fiverr for 5 years, always maintaining 5-star reviews, and never received any negative feedback on my account. Recently, I worked with an African client. She made me do a lot of extra tasks outside the order without payment, and when I refused to continue without additional charges, she became unsatisfied. Later, she delayed the order review unnecessarily and requested a refund from support — which is unfair, because she is still using the website I designed. When I disagreed to refund, she reported that I insulted her. She presented my words “African Woman” as hate speech, but I only mentioned it to describe her identity, not in any offensive way. Fiverr still decided to refund her and permanently suspend my Level Two Seller account, Ticket Number: #13755545. Is refusing to do unpaid extra work really my fault? As a Level Two Seller with a clean record, I expected fair support. Doesn’t Fiverr consider the seller’s side? Reply from Fiverr Hi Atiqul, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

My project began in December 2024 and dragged on for over 8 months, only to be canceled twice by Fiverr Support — even though I never once agreed to cancellation. Initial Order – December 2024: The seller delivered only a partial file (around 2,000 rows) a few days after the order started. This was useless to me and is explicitly against Fiverr’s own rules (partial delivery is not allowed). I contacted Support and very clearly asked only for the “delivered” status to be removed since the order was not actually complete. I specifically wrote that I did not want the order canceled. Despite my clear instructions, Support canceled the order anyway. This was the first mistake, effectively rewarding a seller for violating the rules because they faced no punishment for this action. Re-Order – January 2025: Despite this, the seller agreed to restart the order. This means they confirmed twice (both at the beginning and at the restart) that the project was clear and doable. Nothing about the scope or content ever changed. After the restart, no further work was delivered at all. The seller repeatedly gave new deadlines (their own, not mine), sometimes promising completion in “3 to 8 days,” but never followed through. I actively engaged with them, asking direct questions, suggesting possible solutions, and even offering to pay extra if that would help. The seller ignored all of this. Instead, they gave false updates claiming they were still “pushing forward,” when in reality they had done nothing since the re-order began. Eventually, when I laid out all the facts, they simply stopped responding completely. Support’s Second Mistake – July/August 2025: Later, in July and August 2025, Fiverr Support initiated and approved a cancellation of the re-order without my agreement. I never received a cancellation request and never approved one. The cancellation notice misleadingly stated that the order was canceled because I “did not respond” to the seller. In reality, Support forced the cancellation because the seller failed to respond. This directly contradicts the promises I was given and misrepresents my engagement. I was active the entire time, rejected every cancellation request, and continued trying to move the project forward. Support mischaracterized the situation, making it look as if I were unresponsive or complicit, which is simply false. The Result: Both the initial order and the re-order were canceled by Support against my wishes. The seller confirmed twice that they could do the work, but never delivered beyond the first 2,000 rows. I lost more than 8 months of my time with nothing to show for it. The seller faced zero consequences for repeatedly lying, stalling, ignoring solutions, and refusing to deliver. I was blocked from leaving a review — meaning other buyers cannot see the truth about this seller’s behavior. Conclusion: This case shows how broken Fiverr’s system is. Even when a seller agrees to a project twice, never delivers, lies about progress, and then goes silent, Fiverr Support will still cancel the order in a way that protects the seller and silences the buyer. It is clear that Fiverr’s policies protect bad actors: by canceling orders through Support, buyers are denied the chance to leave negative reviews, which means bad sellers can continue without consequences. I stayed active, rejected cancellations, offered help, and even offered to pay more. Despite that, Support canceled the order against my will not once, but twice. This is not buyer protection. This is disgusting behavior from Fiverr, and it proves that they care more about shielding sellers than about standing up for their paying customers.

Recently, I ordered a physical U.S. business address service, which I confirmed with the seller was legal before placing the order. After delivery, I discovered the seller had provided a fake, edited document. I immediately reported this to Fiverr. Instead of taking action against the seller, Fiverr permanently banned my account, claiming “unlawful or possibly illegal intent.” I never intended to break any rules, never posed as anyone else, and always used my real name and details. I was simply a customer looking for legitimate services and was misled by a dishonest freelancer.

In addition to the fact that you can no longer look for your own clients... I think the best solution would have been to sign up for a membership that would give you at least 100 opportunities to bid per month, and thus be able to continue searching for active clients yourself.

They try to force the app with ads then the app doesn't work or show all the website features. The notification button doesn't work in their app right now so it has check marks showing notifications but never updates to show what it was about. The artist have a baseline pay they expect then when you talk to them they try to charge 3 or 4 times more money. They should be expected to showcase their real price from the get go so no haggling since they lie on their showcased profile. Then fiverr expects you to tip. I am not tipping anyone unless its a waitress or a bellhop. That just makes the artist get paid more for the job which was/is already overpriced anyway. Screw that!!! They charge too much, take too long, don't talk you to professionally to tailor the needed, don't go the extra mile, they don't speak or understand English apparently because they can not follow simple instructions so I am not tipping for that. Details matter. If I took the time to write the details in the job then they matter. If you over look those details then the rating I give will go down. I will still pay if most of the art is what I asked for but if you missed the full mark then I am not giving 5 stars or a damn tip. Plus they forgot that PayPal charges the client on top as well. I shouldn't have to pay the freelancer extra to cover their PayPal fees. There's no search by country to try and get yourself a real English speaker and American professional. The categories are laid out weird and suck. I can not tell if an artist uses a certain program or not. Then when I say I need a clip studio paint artist it brings up un-related artist.

My reviews are detailed, enthusiastic, and specific—yet none of that seems to matter. Once I began charging higher rates that reflect the true value of my work, Fiverr drastically cut my visibility. I was removed from search pages, and my exposure plummeted. Their explanation? Vague and nonsensical. I invested in Seller Plus and Fiverr Ads, hoping to regain visibility once more. What did I get? Nothing—except faster access to my own earnings, which I now have to pay for. That’s right: freelancers must pay Fiverr to receive their own money more quickly. Even worse, Fiverr claims that “private, confidential reviews” are what truly matter. These are invisible to sellers, never explained, and impossible to address. No matter how perfect your public reviews are, they won’t protect you. It’s a system built on opacity and nonsense Customer support? Passive-aggressive and unhelpful. Instead of offering solutions, they deflect and defend a broken system. Sadly, but they're employees after all. And let’s not forget the 21% commission Fiverr takes from every order—including tips and withdrawal. Yes, even the money clients voluntarily give you is taxed by the platform. Freelancers deserve transparency, respect, and fair treatment. Fiverr is failing us on all fronts. Reply from Fiverr Hi there, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

But the reality is, unless you're already established or pay for promoted gigs, you're buried at the bottom — completely invisible. The platform is clearly designed to favour long-standing sellers. New freelancers get no visibility, no support, and no genuine opportunity to grow. After weeks of zero traction, it became clear that Fiverr isn't a level playing field — it’s a closed loop for the same top sellers. Worst of all, when I deactivated my account, there were no questions, no attempt to understand why I was leaving, and no care shown. That tells you everything about how much they value their users. If you're hoping to build a freelance business from scratch, look elsewhere. Fiverr talks about opportunity, but in reality, it delivers disappointment.

Then there is the waiting and waiting for my payments to come through...its been more than two weeks and I am still waiting for a payment to clear. The first one took almost a month. Nobody can withdraw any money until you hit a $100 balance, which Fiverr claims is to keep fees low...but if they can take the slow bridge to pay me, then why no pick up that difference in the balance required for withdraw. I think it's pretty sheisty. The rating system is cryptic and I never really know why customer success score goes up and down, and I have no idea what that score actually means...yet it dictates my moving up into levels...which are also arbitrary...yet totally dictate my visibility on Fiverr. If you are going to hold someone accountable to a score of some kind...at least let them know what that score is composed of, and give them the opportunity to alter their behavior as necessary. Fiverr is incredibly buyer-side focused, which is lovely and all...if you're a buyer.

She claimed to have over 200k in her audience reach via social media. However, once I received the finished file, I immediately noticed that her \"audience\" was completely made up of bots. There was zero real engagement or value, and the work was not as promised. I asked for a cancellation right away. She refused. I asked again—no response. When I called her unprofessional (which she was), she accused me of calling her names and again denied the cancellation. Since then, she hasn’t responded at all. I also reached out to Fiverr customer service and spoke with Megha and Alaya. Unfortunately, they were no help either. They barely replied, then completely stopped responding. According to Fiverr’s terms and conditions, I am eligible for a credit, yet Emily claimed I wasn’t—which is false. Her behavior has been dishonest and misleading. At this point, I’m planning to file a complaint with the Attorney General’s office so they can investigate possible fraud happening through this platform. This whole experience has been beyond frustrating. Fiverr seems to protect scammers and does little to support honest buyers. If you’re considering using Fiverr for book marketing—don’t. Save your money and go with a reputable company instead. I wouldn’t recommend this platform to anyone. Reply from Fiverr Hi Aaliyha. We appreciate you for sharing your order experience.

I wanted to suggest a feature that I think could add great value to the site: It would be amazing if Fiverr supported automatic delivery of digital products – like eBooks, templates, audio files, PDFs, or any downloadable content. For example, if a seller wants to offer a digital book, they could upload the file in advance, and once a buyer purchases it, the file would be sent to them instantly without any manual action. This would streamline the process, save time, and open up opportunities for passive income. Other platforms already offer this, and adding it to Fiverr could benefit both sellers and Fiverr itself – more sales, less friction, and new types of creators joining the marketplace. Thanks for considering this idea – I really believe it could take the platform even further! 🙏 Reply from Fiverr HI Moran, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review and we will make sure to forward your feedback to the relevant team.

I have spent over £500 on this Fiverr Gig, yet it remains \"Useless\" and \"Not Fit For Purpose\". There seems no way of complaining to Fiverr concerning this issue.

You look for a game design advert which on other platform it's exceptional work for just £20 on one other platform and most freelancers here atleast 75% of them will chuck you a £200 - £300 quote for the same thing. Talking about being greedy. There's also some scammers on this platform and trust me dispite fiver saying you're covered for your money. These scammers make you feel like you have to mark the order as complete as its taking a while and it doesn't want to damage their profile reviews. And get more customers to gain a level up. However once you mark the order as complete fiver support won't help you! Clearly I waited 3 months for a model and my freelancer was taking for ever so I decided to give up and contact support for my money back. Apparently I was outside the Grace period and dispite fiver saw my chats with the freelancer \"he gave me a video as my order\" I clearly requested a \"model\" yet fiver support doesn't approve this. I could do a visa dispute or further take fiver to court but honestly I don't have that motivation. Just be aware that most freelancers here are extremely greedy. Just find a indipenant company or alternative freelance platforms. Reply from Fiverr Hi there, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We're sorry to hear abour your experience.

The freelancer has created the website after 3 months! The website could not go through testing. Finally, when I informed the freelancer that I decided to stop the cooperation he refused to give me the key to the website. After a week of communication he gave a false key. I had to find a reputable UK company and do the website from scratch. The revision of the IT specialists of the company showed that the website was just created with a big number of plugins (over 20!!!). Moreover, the freelancer used my hosting as a storage space for his software without my permission. Besides. I was told that the hidden admin panel was created. I was told that it look like that the freelancer is a blackmailer. He creates the website and when the business grows he blocks the normal work of the website and offers his help for money.

So believe me when I say I’ve seen it all. And honestly? The experience has gone downhill. Almost every time, I felt like I was being screwed. Delivery? Frequently late. Not always awful, I’ll admit, some freelancers do deliver solid work, but I’ve had too many cases where it felt like people were intentionally playing dumb just to avoid putting in the extra effort. An effort I already paid for and we agreed on upfront. What really bugs me isn’t even the delays. It's that the freelancers here act like they know they can cut corners and still get away with it. There’s just this general lack of professional conscience. I’m not trying to be harsh for the sake of it, I love supporting creators. But for the money I’ve put in, I expected a much more reliable and professional experience. Right now? I will stop using your website No more ‘let’s give it one last chance.’ UPDATE: My last order was a disaster... no promise fulfilled, ignored messages, and then charging 50$ for requesting a simply adjusting to the colors . the Support stepped in a few times but nothing changed. On the bright side, Fiverr’s team did give me $100 in credits (good for 90 days), which showed me they really do care about customers. But they’ve still got to be tougher on freelancers who pull stunt like this, mine walked away without any consequences. Reply from Fiverr Hi Ash, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

It shamelessly favors sellers who already have reviews, leaving new sellers completely out in the cold. Unless you already have a handful of positive reviews, you’re basically invisible — no traffic, no orders, no chance. Let’s be real: the only way to get started on Fiverr is to buy your first few reviews or beg friends to place fake orders. That’s the unspoken rule, and Fiverr knows it. Their algorithm is built in a way that forces new sellers to game the system just to get noticed. It’s not about talent, quality, or reliability — it’s about who already has momentum. And that’s pathetic for a platform that claims to support freelancers. If Fiverr actually cared about fairness or merit, they’d give new sellers a shot at visibility based on performance, not just review count. Right now? It’s a rigged game. If you’re new, good luck — you’re on your own. Reply from Fiverr Hi Lorenzo, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We understand how important it is to get orders.

Some time later, in deciding to try a new account and taking weeks to set it up, it would not accept my phone number due to it being tied to the former account that I could no longer even access. Once again, no one on the Fiverr side could actually help with this and insisted I had to log in to deactivate, which I could not do. Then finally, after remembering why I chose not to use Fiverr in the first place, because it does not work, I get an email stating they have deactivated my account after all, after 9 months of trying to get them to deactivate it. I have never in my existence tried to work on something that just didn't work. To those who managed to get a profile up and running, well done to you, my experience has been awful. But good riddance. So essentially what was asked of them to do, delete my profile, took 9 months and hours of emails and attempts, all of which they insisted they could not do, and then they just somehow managed. Upon reviewing \"reviews\" it seems like they a have a lot of shady buisness tactics. 1) your profile gets lost in the plethora of profiles unless you have reviews. 2) if you leave an honest review for someone's sub par work, they won't allow you to publish it. 3) random people who want to offer you work off the profile don't get banned... 4) if you message sellers with quesions, you get banned for trying to sell offline... Just don't bother. Also Fiverr, no idea why you NOW bother to post a reply. I WILL NEVER TOUCH YOUR SERVICE AGAIN, NOR DO I CARE TO READ YOUR LIES.

My experience has been beyond frustrating. As a brand-new seller, I was excited to publish my first gig. Within hours, I received a message from a scammer asking for my email to process an \"offline payment,\" which is a clear violation of Fiverr's rules. I did the right thing: I refused and replied by stating that all communication and payments must stay on the platform for security. The result? My account (larissags) was permanently banned almost instantly. The scammer, who I was trying to report, likely flagged my account, and Fiverr's automated system punished me, the victim. This is where the nightmare began. Fiverr's support system is a fortress designed to keep you out. You cannot contact support without being logged in, but how can you log in if your account is disabled? It's a nonsensical loop. Forced by this broken system, I had to create a second account for the sole purpose of contacting support—the only possible way to open a ticket. I explained this entire situation in detail, providing screenshots as irrefutable proof. The response I received after days of waiting was a generic, copy-paste template, falsely accusing me of the very thing I was fighting against (phishing). They completely ignored my evidence and the context. To add insult to injury, they lectured me about creating a second account, even though their own flawed system forced me to do it. My case could have been resolved in minutes by a human with common sense. Instead, I was met with bots, automated responses, and a support team that clearly doesn't read the tickets. This isn't just bad customer service; it's a dangerously unjust process that punishes honest users and protects scammers. Fiverr, you need to fix this. Your sellers deserve a support system that is accessible, fair, and capable of distinguishing victims from rule-breakers.

After losing access to my Fiverr account due to my email being compromised, I reached out to Fiverr’s support team for assistance. Unfortunately, despite receiving an initial response from a representative named Jessica, I have not heard back in weeks, and my issue remains unresolved. I have tried multiple times to follow up, but Fiverr has ignored my requests and seems to be taking no responsibility for the situation. This is a huge concern as I have important client work, projects, and messages on my account that I am unable to access, affecting my business and reputation. Fiverr’s support is terrible, and it’s clear they do not prioritize helping their users when there’s an urgent issue. At this point, I’m left with no way to get my work back, and I’ve received no meaningful communication. It feels like Fiverr just doesn’t care about its users. I strongly advise you to be cautious when using Fiverr, as their customer service is ineffective and the platform has no way of helping in case of account issues.

But sadly, I’ve now faced two bad experiences where clients abused the revision and cancellation system — and both times, I was left without payment despite doing all the work properly. In my most recent case, the buyer kept putting the order into revision without giving specific feedback. I contacted Fiverr support multiple times. Support agents confirmed that I delivered the work on time and as required, and even told me the order was completed. But later, I was shocked to get a notification that the order was canceled and I was also left with a false, harmful review. A similar thing happened in a previous order as well — the client took the work and still canceled it unfairly, and Fiverr support again couldn't protect my effort. Fiverr needs to take seller protection more seriously. Hardworking freelancers are getting punished for doing everything right. I’ve lost both money and reputation for situations completely out of my control. I truly hope Fiverr improves the fairness of their dispute system. Until then, I can’t feel secure as a seller on this platform. Reply from Fiverr Hi Mukarram, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We're sorry to hear about your order experience.

I placed an order (Order ID: FO82E93A747C6) with a seller after conducting a proper Zoom meeting, where I provided all the necessary details for a website project. The seller submitted a completely incomplete delivery—only a logo, with none of the promised website work. I repeatedly tried to contact the seller after the delivery, but received no response. Due to the seller’s lack of communication and failure to deliver the service I paid for, I reached out to my bank to dispute the charge. However, I later received an email from Fiverr claiming they would resolve the issue if I withdrew the dispute. Trusting them, I withdrew the dispute — only to find out that they permanently disabled my account afterwards, accusing me of unlawful activity without any clear explanation. I have never violated Fiverr's terms. I do not own multiple accounts, nor did I act in bad faith. I simply tried to recover money for work that was never completed. Even after all this, Fiverr refused to refund my money, and refused to reopen my account, despite me offering to follow all guidelines moving forward. As someone who used Fiverr in good faith, this experience has left me feeling frustrated, unheard, and financially cheated. If you’re a buyer on Fiverr, be extremely cautious — if something goes wrong, their so-called “buyer protection” means absolutely nothing.

But Fiverr refused to pay me for a completely unreasonable reason: “The system detected that you referred directly to the Fiverr website”.

The fact that they used such a reason to refuse payment shows a lack of transparency and trustworthiness. Furthermore, they did not warn me or provide any concrete evidence, they simply refused to pay and ended the matter.

I hired a highly rated seller (“Luccidamus”) for a $1,171, 3-month music marketing package. The contract was uploaded to Fiverr and linked to the order ID, so I thought I was covered by Fiverr ToS. Right after the contract was submitted, the seller asked me to mark the order “complete” and move all work to WhatsApp — a clear violation of Fiverr’s Terms, which I didn’t realize at the time. From that point on, everything happened off-platform. The seller ignored my requests, promoted unrelated content, submitted my music to completely off-target podcasts, used unlicensed copywriter material showing complete disregard for my brand reputation, and even asked to use my work in his own projects. When I requested a refund, he responded with dismissiveness and a discriminatory comment. The only file ever uploaded to Fiverr was the PDF contract — not a single actual deliverable. Fiverr later claimed that this pdf fulfilled the seller’s obligation, since it was marked as \"complete\" even though no work was done: no strategy, no fan growth, no relevant outreach. Fiverr support refused to act — until I escalated the case externally. Only then was the order cancelled and refunded. Key lessons for buyers Never mark an order “complete” even if the seller insists Keep all work and communication on Fiverr Do not make large upfront payments, try to pay in increments Don’t trust reviews — many buyers don’t realize what quality service looks like, and by the time they realize it, it is too late to update the review I’ve had some good experiences in the past. But this case revealed serious weaknesses in buyer protection and accountability. I would also avoid this seller who clearly had no marketing expertise.

Instead of Fiverr returning my funds to my card, they gave me a $474.00 credit and when I went to use my \"credit\" to work with someone else the \"credit\" had been taken back. The second customer service representative that I dealt with admitted I never received services for my funds but that he could NOT schedule a call with anyone and could only push my claim forward. The third person was a shift supervisor the next day who basically started my claim all over and then quit responding. Over two months later and I'm still out of my $474.00. I recommend using a platform that values their patrons, hold themselves accountable for their shortcomings and provides customer service you can actually speak with, but if you have funds to throw away...

Her site said she charged $150. She stated that was for only 4 chapters; since my book had 9 chapters, she would charge me $290. I paid for it by credit card. Afterwards, she said I needed to write a script for the video. I told her I understood she was supposed to do that. She said it would cost me an additional $250. So I canceled the project. She refused to cancel on her end, and went ahead with the project anyway. I repeatedly told her I was canceling, but she refused to listen to me. I went through Fiverr customer support, explaining I had found another freelancer who was more honest and charged less, but they backed her up. She sent me the project, and Fiverr said I had to find something wrong with it to reject it. I rejected it, stating this was not what I had ordered. (I had ordered a REFUND!) Jennifer S. kept on pestering me about accepting the project, so I finally went to my credit card company, and it issued me a refund. She sent me the project again, offering it at a discount. Since she obviously wasn't listening to me, I didn't bother to respond. Since Fiverr is obviously backing up someone who is blatantly unprofessional, not to mention dishonest, I decided it would be prudent to no longer do business on this platform. I informed the other freelancer that I would not be commissioning her services. Now, Fiverr has suspended my account, saying I had violated its terms of agreement. I suppose it's just as well. UPDATE 08/09/25 Jennifer S. delivered the product, then charged me again. I found out when I paid my credit card bill. I disputed the charge again, providing screenshots of our conversation. They said Fiverr told them it is against their policy to cancel services, so I'm stuck. I am NEVER using this platform again!!!!

But clearly, Fiverr doesn’t care about helping new freelancers who are trying to get started. I recently had a paying customer, ready and waiting for delivery. But because I couldn't instantly verify my bank account (Payoneer required me to have over 3000 SEK just to verify), I asked Fiverr support if there was any other solution or if my client could get a refund so they wouldn’t be stuck. I wasn’t rude. I didn’t demand anything. Their response? They threatened to ban my account just for asking. No empathy. No help. Just straight-up warnings and cold, robotic answers. What kind of platform punishes new creators for trying to ask for help? I thought Fiverr was meant to support freelancers, but it feels like they only care about protecting their systems — not their users. Bottom line: If you’re a new seller trying to survive, be careful. Fiverr expects you to act like a company with money, resources, and legal documents — even if you’re just starting out. They act like you’re guilty for having questions. I’ve lost trust in the platform, and I’m not the only one. Of course i warned the regarding customer about Fiverrs way handeling customers.

We understand that you are upset about our Success Score. When it comes to how it works, the success score metric evaluates each of your Gigs in key areas related to the order process and your relationship with clients, with the history of each Gig examined to determine a score, relative to other freelancers. Ratings, reviews, and feedback is one of many indicators used, not the only thing. The key areas evaluated include client satisfaction, effective communication, conflict-free orders, order cancellations, delivery time, value for money.To improve the areas with a negative impact, take a look at the tips provided in the article linked below, along with the resources available on your dashboard and by contacting our Support Team.

The freelancer delivered only a “view-only” Figma link – no file, no edit access, no export. This made the result completely unusable for my project. Despite multiple follow-ups, the freelancer stopped responding. I contacted Fiverr Support, who acknowledged the missing collaboration and promised help – but after the 14-day mark, they refused any refund, even though I never received a proper file. Their argument was that the order was “delivered”, even if I couldn’t use it at all. I provided proof (screenshots and explanations), and still, nothing happened. Fiverr’s process prioritizes technical delivery over real value – even if what you receive is effectively worthless. Be extremely careful working with Fiverr for serious design or tech projects.

As an artist who creates physical, high-effort pieces, I’ve been forced to front the cost of materials, time, and shipping, only to have orders held hostage for weeks — sometimes over a month — while Fiverr decides if I'm “worthy” of getting paid. Meanwhile, the customer pays Fiverr immediately, but I see nothing until long after the job is done… assuming it’s not cancelled arbitrarily, in which case I get absolutely nothing. Want to know if a client is legit, or has a history of scamming sellers? Too bad — Fiverr hides that data behind a paid monthly “Seller Plus” subscription. You have to pay Fiverr just to see if your next buyer is real. You’d think they’d invest that 25% cut into helping sellers — instead, you get a cryptic “Success Score” tanked by invisible private feedback, buyer-requested extensions, or clients adding extra work after the order starts. The system punishes you for flexibility and favors only those who churn out quick, templated digital gigs. Promoting your work? That’s locked behind a “level system” based on dozens of vague metrics, including the same opaque Success Score you have no control over. It’s a system designed to exploit effort, reward volume, and push accountability onto creators while Fiverr quietly collects fees — without owning any of the risk. If you’re just flipping logos or templates, Fiverr might work. If you’re a real artist, maker, or specialist: run. Reply from Fiverr Hello Dan, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

The channels had over 2 years of effort: • CD Computers Life – 900+ subs, 60+ videos (since 2020) • IC-Stories2024 – 600+ subs, one video with 48,000+ views • ISLAM4ALL – 560+ subs, 40+ videos I provided evidence, chat logs, and clear proof of the seller’s misconduct. Fiverr refunded the order — but refused to offer any compensation or accountability, despite permanent damage to my brand and livelihood. Be very careful trusting Fiverr with your long-term work. One wrong order can erase everything — and you’ll be left alone to deal with it. Update: Fiverr has now refused compensation despite clear evidence and internal acknowledgment (seller removed). I’ve submitted a formal claim via UK Small Claims Court (Form N1). It’s important that creators are protected from unsafe services offered on their marketplace. I have formally given Fiverr until Friday, 11th July 2025 to offer a resolution. If they fail to do so, I will proceed with a Small Claims Court filing (UK MCOL). All evidence has already been submitted to Fiverr and published publicly. My experience is well-documented, and this update is simply to inform others of the final steps. I remain open to a fair resolution. Reply from Fiverr Hi Chad, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We are sorry to hear about your experience. We have sent you an email via Trust Pilot.

We understand that you are concerned about your Success Score. We will be sure to share your feedback on ways we can enhance the success score metric, as well as our ratings, reviews, and feedback feature.When it comes to how it works, the success score metric evaluates each of your Gigs in key areas related to the order process and your relationship with clients, with the history of each Gig examined to determine a score, relative to other freelancers. Ratings, reviews, and feedback is one of many indicators used, not the only thing. The key areas evaluated include client satisfaction, effective communication, conflict-free orders, order cancellations, delivery time, value for money.To improve the areas with a negative impact, take a look at the tips provided in the article linked below, along with the resources available on your dashboard and by contacting our Support Team. This information provides a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to your success score and how you can evaluate your gig for improvements.You can find our Help Center article on Success Score here: https://help.fiverr.com/hc/en-us/articles/21965360854673-Success-score If you have any concerns and wish for our Support Team to take a look at your account, you're welcome to reach out at support@fiverr.com.

However when I chose to become a seller myself I filled out everything needed including my tax information, and only after I give sensitive information am I banned for fraud/suspicious behavior. This happened just after I had got the information approved through their w2 checking process. Mind you I was in good standing with the freelancers I worked with. When I contacted their support team all I get is their typical cookie cutter response. \"You were banned for tos violations and thats all we can share.\" I understand Fiverr has the right to control their site, I'm not writing the review based on that in its self. The timing of the ban is a serious red flag and should be investigated. Another thing for people to understand is even if you're accused of something like fraud or suspicious behavior they will still allow you to purchase from sellers who then get part of the money you pay from the seller. So basically screw the sellers and their money, give us money. Stay away, pull your business from their site and never return. I have told them that if they don't explain the ban, and yet I can still pay I will report their business to the proper authorities. Edit: If you guys see they responded to my review with the same cookie cutter responce they do to just about any support ticket. big tip to fiverrs support team, if someone is accused of fraud (suspicious) like behavior, which we both agree was the issue in this case. Maybe don't let them use the site at all. period. As well, in that same support ticket, I asked how my information (Social Security number) was being used and no response, or should I say no real response. TLDR, basically if you're a seller be warned not only will fiverr rip you off by taking a larger sum of money from the purchase, they will also allow users who apparently are suspected of bad things like fraud or likewise behavior.

However, recently I have noticed a significant decline in the number of orders I receive, despite maintaining high-quality work and good customer ratings. I believe this may be due to changes in the buyer-seller matching algorithm or increased competition, but it has made sustaining my freelance business challenging. I kindly suggest Fiverr consider: Improving the visibility and promotion of experienced, high-rated sellers to ensure consistent order flow. Providing more detailed analytics or insights to help sellers understand and improve their gig performance. Offering more support or educational resources focused on adapting to changes in the platform. I hope Fiverr continues to grow as a fair and supportive marketplace for freelancers.

As someone who has spent a lot of time, effort, and resources promoting Fiverr across multiple channels, including blogs, social media platforms, and targeted communities, I would expect at least a transparent and fair process when it comes to commission payouts. Unfortunately, that has not been the case. Despite driving real traffic and official signups, Fiverr has failed to deliver on the agreed affiliate commissions. What is even more troubling is the lack of communication, vague excuses, and complete lack of accountability from the Fiverr affiliate team. This experience feels more like a one-sided relationship than a partnership where only Fiverr benefits. It is incredibly disheartening to see a platform that considers itself professional and creator-friendly behave in such a shady and dismissive manner towards its own promoters. This treatment not only discourages affiliates, but also damages the reputation of the entire Fiverr ecosystem.

I even upgraded my account to their premium seller subscription expecting faster support and more trust from the platform. What I got instead? The worst treatment I’ve ever experienced as a freelancer. Fiverr is currently holding $917 of my cleared funds, even though the order was: Fully completed and delivered Reviewed with a 5-star rating from the buyer Free of any cancellations, disputes, or refund requests Already held for Fiverr’s standard 14-day clearance period Even after all that, they disabled my withdrawal access with no real explanation, and their support team has been absolutely useless. I’ve sent multiple tickets. No real people ever reply — only bots sending automated “help” messages that don’t help at all. To make it worse, they asked me to “submit proof of delivery” — after I already submitted a 16-page custom-written document as my order. It’s the same high-level work I’ve done for other clients on the platform with no issues. I delivered EXACTLY what I was paid to do. They’re ignoring that. At this point, it feels like Fiverr is treating sellers like free labor. You expect me to write and work and deliver — and then I wait 14 days just to be eligible to withdraw. And then you still won’t release the money? That’s not just bad business — it feels like slavery. I did the work, I delivered it, I got a 5-star review. And I’m still being punished? I can’t even pay for new advertising, or fund new projects because my capital is locked up by a company that already took their 20% cut INSTANTLY — but won’t pay me what I earned. If you're a freelancer reading this: do NOT trust Fiverr with your money. You could put in hours of real work, deliver it perfectly, and still not be paid. Meanwhile, Fiverr uses your money, probably earns interest on it, and leaves you with nothing but auto-responses. Fiverr is killing businesses like mine by handicapping sellers who depend on their income to grow and survive. This isn’t a glitch — this is how they treat hard-working sellers who make them money.

I contacted support about serious issues with my portfolio images being cropped and compressed, making my design work look unprofessional. I explained everything clearly, shared a YouTube video, and followed all guidelines. Over 10 days, I was passed between at least 5 people (Pratik, Ubaid, Owen, Zaid, and Supervisor Miles). None of them solved the issue. They repeated generic copy-paste replies, ignored my actual questions, and stalled for days. Even after compressing and uploading the video as requested, they claimed there was “nothing new to offer.” I paid for Seller Plus for faster, dedicated support — but I was ignored, dismissed, and left without a solution. This has cost me time, credibility, and trust in the platform. If you’re a visual freelancer who cares about quality and support: avoid Fiverr. How can I respond Brenda?? ARE YOU FOR REAL?

This is not just poor customer service — it’s a complete betrayal of anyone trying to use Fiverr honestly. Fiverr’s system is rigged to protect scammers and punish buyers.

Fiverr is nothing but bunch of un-qualified individuals claiming to be artists creating ads for services of which they do not follow at all. For example, I decided to have my company logo animated. I chose an individual who claimed they would animate my logo. Upon receiving the product, my logo was not animated at all, only pasted stationary on a motion template and did not move at all. Upon asking the freelancer why he didn’t animate my logo he said oh that I have to pay extra for that. I was willing to pay good money to have it being done not pay money to be deceived. The freelancer did nothing to correct the situation and I ended up having to dispute it with my credit card to get my money back. Fiverr administration did absolutely nothing but side with the freelancer. I think these people forget that here in America we have standards for business practices based on ethical principles of quality and integrity.

Desite sending over ten emails to customer support, I have received only two automated responses. I have had no proper engagement, no case handler, and no resolution. Let me be absolutely clear: your customer service has been appalling the worst I’ve ever experienced using any online platform. In a situation involving forgery, duplicate charges, and a complete scam, this should have been escalated and resolved within 48 hours. Instead, I’ve been ignored. I received no work whatsoever. And as part of the resolution Fiday would like partial payment as a resolution? I'm not understanding that someone can. Can ask for money with no work attempted. With false information, furthermore zero work, and as a resolution asked for partial payment. And allow to do so without any customer service, helping the customer when asked. to prove what work he had done He delivered nothing. I aked for proof for it several times show me what you have nothing. I cancelled plus it was fraudulent. One project and two gigs. For no other reason apart the manipulate threads so it harde to navigate. Juggling from one too another This matter is now formally reported under the UK Consumer Rights Act 2015, the E-Commerce Regulations 2002, and Distance Selling Regulations. Summary of Violations: 1. Non-Delivery of Services The seller “Fiday” manipulated by two different payments. Which I was unaware of. payment and provided nothing: no files, no communication, and no service. This violates Fiverr’s seller obligations and breaches contract law. 2. Duplicate Gigs for a Single Project I was fraudulently charged twicetwo gigs submitted and billed within two minutes, for the exact same project. This is deceptive and unlawful under both Fiverr’s rules and UK consumer protection law. 3. False Advertising The seller misrepresented their abilities and services, violating the UK Misrepresentation Act 1967. 4. Fiverr Terms of Service Breaches Your own terms state: “Sellers must fulfill their orders.” “Fraud and misrepresentation are grounds for account removal.ie peace location is in Pakistan. states he is in the USA. “Non-delivery orders are eligible for cancellation and refund.” Fiverr has not enforced these policies. 5. Negligent Platform Oversight Fiverr has failed in its duty to investigate and act on a clearly reported scam, making the platform jointly liable. Official Consumer Rights Notification: This case is now recorded under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which requires: Digital services to be as described Delivery within a reasonable timeframe A satisfactory standard of service Fiverr has failed on all counts.

There should have been never 2 payments on the scene minute. Come out on my account for 2 gigs. In respect, I suspect it's an easier way of manipulating money out of people. I am not a happy money has come out my account in too duplicate payments. I am a first-time Fiverr user, conned into thinking this was a legitimate process. I was manipulated, overcharged, and ignored. I demand: A full refund of both payments Written acknowledgment of this legal warning Immediate removal of the seller “Fiday” A named representative to take ownership of this case within 72 hours If No Action Is Taken: Failure to resolve this immediately will result in: A formal complaint to UK Trading Standards A Section 75 chargeback through my card provider Reports to the Financial Ombudsman and ICO A public campaign to expose this case across review platforms and forums This is final notice before escalation to all legal and regulatory bodies.

The entire platform is built around promoting people who pay extra for ads, Fiverr Pro, or other “premium” placements. Meanwhile, legitimate freelancers who can’t afford to throw money into Fiverr’s system are buried on the last pages of search results — if they even show up at all. The experience for me has been nothing short of frustrating. Most of the messages I got were from sketchy accounts, scammers, or people trying to bypass Fiverr’s own system. It’s almost impossible to find serious clients or collaborators unless you’ve already paid Fiverr to be “seen.” The platform does nothing to support newer freelancers who are genuinely trying to build up a presence and deliver quality work. It’s incredibly demotivating to watch less-skilled but better-funded sellers constantly appear on top just because they’ve paid for exposure. Fiverr makes it feel like success on the platform isn’t earned — it’s bought. If you’re a new freelancer without a budget for ads or promotions, Fiverr will simply treat you like you don’t exist. Their algorithm punishes people who can’t pay. It’s unfair, manipulative, and exploitative. Fiverr isn’t a freelance marketplace anymore — it’s a pay-to-win advertising system. Avoid it if you care about fairness, integrity, or building real connections. Reply from Fiverr Hi Jan, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

I have not received a response. Hello, I wanted to let you know why I will never use Fiverr again, and why I will do everything in my power to help others avoid your service. I ordered a FULL e-commerce shop from a Maria, whose name is actually Bella Alexa, but who the hell knows what her real name is! Communication was pretty lousy, her English was subpar, she constantly spelled things incorrectly and the product she delivered is plain, base, simple and unimpressive. I thought I was being a good guy by paying $400 when her price range was up to $200. I figured I’d get something that would blow me away, and I’d have an experience much like the fake reviews Fiverr has for its freelancers. When I am paid above and beyond my thought it to go above and beyond. What I got was something she worked on for a single day (shopify shows you this), 3 days after the order was placed and was made by someone with little to no experience in website design. I was horrified at what she claimed to be a delivered product. This is disgraceful and pathetic, and it falls well below my paltry, ground-level expectations. This person is a scammer a liar, a thief, a degenerate scumbag with no morals. I think Fiverr deliberately works with scammers, has no interest in providing a service that’s of any value, and is run by a bunch of bots.

I hired a freelancer to build a Shopify theme, which was supposed to take 30 days. After 80 days, countless delays, and constant assurances that the work was progressing, the final delivery was incomplete and unusable — as clearly shown in the video I submitted during the dispute. Despite providing all the evidence and explaining the impact this delay had on my business, Fiverr sided with the freelancer based on hours logged — completely ignoring the quality and final result. Their resolution was for me to keep working with the same freelancer who already wasted almost 3 months of my time. That’s simply not acceptable. I had no choice but to purchase another solution from elsewhere and request a chargeback from my bank. Fiverr’s dispute system failed to protect me as a buyer, and I’m left frustrated, out of money, and deeply dissatisfied.

My level went down from 2 to 1, and then from 1 to 0. My reached dropped and I started having less and less orders. After they implemented the \"success score\" at some point (which is the biggest bs of all time) I barely came up to level 1 after a long long time, but my reach is still terrible and now I only get like 3 or 4 orders per YEAR.

Reply from Fiverr Hi there, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We will be sure to share your feedback on ways we can enhance the success score metric, as well as our ratings, reviews, and feedback feature.When it comes to how it works, the success score metric evaluates each of your Gigs in key areas related to the order process and your relationship with clients, with the history of each Gig examined to determine a score, relative to other freelancers. Ratings, reviews, and feedback is one of many indicators used, not the only thing. The key areas evaluated include client satisfaction, effective communication, conflict-free orders, order cancellations, delivery time, value for money.To improve the areas with a negative impact, take a look at the tips provided in the article linked below, along with the resources available on your dashboard and by contacting our Support Team. This information provides a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to your success score and how you can evaluate your gig for improvements.You can find our Help Center article on Success Score here: https://help.fiverr.com/hc/en-us/articles/21965360854673-Success-scoreRegarding cancelations, anytime a buyer requests a cancellation, we carefully reviews the circumstances around the request along with the delivery. If you have any further questions regarding your Success Score or an order, please don’t hesitate to reach out to our Support Team at fvrr.co/help.

First, getting consistent work is a real challenge. The competition is extremely high, and Fiverr's ranking algorithm often favors a select few sellers, making it harder for new or mid-level freelancers to grow. Second, the service fees are significantly high. Taking 20% from every order, and then also deducting withdrawal charges, feels excessive — especially when compared to other freelance platforms. While the interface is user-friendly and the buyer protection system is strong, the core issues of visibility and high commission make it difficult to fully rely on Fiverr as a sustainable income source.

As a new business owner, I was relying on their claimed expertise to help me get started. They were very friendly during the project phase and kept asking me to wait 2–3 weeks after each order for “results” to appear. Trusting their word and the Fiverr platform, I waited — only to find that none of the promised results were delivered. By the time I realized nothing was working, I had missed Fiverr’s refund window, not because I was negligent, but because I was acting on their advice to wait. When I brought this to Fiverr’s customer support with clear proof, they refused a full refund and only offered $100 in non-refundable credit, which doesn’t even come close to the amount I spent. To make things worse, the freelancers became rude and tried to convince me to buy more services, instead of acknowledging the failures of the previous ones. This experience has been incredibly disappointing. Fiverr promotes itself as a secure and trustworthy platform, but when a customer is misled and the system fails to protect them, what’s the point of trusting it again? I’ve opened a formal complaint and will be exploring a BBB report and payment dispute if this remains unresolved. I hope Fiverr seriously reviews how it handles these kinds of cases, especially for new customers who rely on the platform in good faith.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=53","page_number":53},{"reviewer_name":"Christopher Roan","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/659d9be6f440a000121e146c","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"CR","date":null,"star_rating":"1","review_text":"Awful company for sellers.

I placed an order on March 5, 2025, for 30 YouTube videos and paid $2,954. Order ID: FO427222279C8 Fiverr Username: Limule_Tempest The seller delivered an empty Google Drive link with no videos — absolutely no work. Since I was out of town, I couldn’t check right away, and Fiverr auto-completed the order on March 13. When I came back, I saw the scam and contacted Fiverr support with full evidence, screenshots, and everything. I messaged them multiple times, but they did nothing. Instead, they restricted my account and later told me they don’t have the funds — even though the order was clearly canceled for non-delivery. I’ve lost my money and received nothing in return. I’m seriously considering legal action. To anyone thinking of using Fiverr: DON’T. They protect scammers, ignore real issues, and leave honest customers helpless. I’m extremely disappointed and feel completely scammed. Reply from Fiverr Hi Humayun, Thanks for taking the time to share your feedback.

If you give a $5 tip on a $10 job they add on a fee of $4.40 which is a giant portion of the price and in relative terms extortion. What business is it of theirs to take money for a tip when the whole concept of tipping is or should be for the party who did all the work? The net effect is that it is a potential deterrent to tip... I tell you the people that think up these rules or strategies are as dumb as a rock.. Reply from Fiverr Hi Fergus, We’re so grateful you took the time to leave a review and share your experience with us — thank you for your valuable feedback! We understand that understanding fees is important, so we’d like to provide some clarity. Our fees are carefully designed to enable us to deliver the high-quality product/service and exceptional support our customers rely on. They help cover the necessary operational costs associated with every transaction, ensuring a smooth and reliable experience for everyone. It’s also important to note that when a tip is added, it’s handled as a distinct transaction. This means that a separate service fee is applied to that specific tip transaction, just as it would be for any other payment. Thank you again for your understanding and for being a valued part of our community!

I paid a freelancer by the name of “MD Saiful Islam” do develop an app on my behalf. The project was stated to take 30 days.

He would only reach out when I mentioned or request for an update. Even then it was nothing but excuses, like “my main developer got in an accident”. I asked MD Saiful Islam to provide an update every Monday and still nothing! Now discuss why the company FIVERR is a scam. FIVERR only allows a 14-day grace period for cancellation to get your money back . So if the project takes more than 14 days or like in my case, the freelancer stop responding after 14 days you’re pretty much out of money. The support team are not very helpful. They respond with AI generated responses, which I felt like I was talking to a computer. Constantly reminding and informing them on how I wanted the situation to handle.

We will be sure to share your feedback on ways we can enhance the success score metric, as well as our ratings, reviews, and feedback feature.When it comes to how it works, the success score metric evaluates each of your Gigs in key areas related to the order process and your relationship with clients, with the history of each Gig examined to determine a score, relative to other freelancers. Ratings, reviews, and feedback is one of many indicators used, not the only thing. The key areas evaluated include client satisfaction, effective communication, conflict-free orders, order cancellations, delivery time, value for money. To improve the areas with a negative impact, take a look at the tips provided in the article linked below, along with the resources available on your dashboard and by contacting our Support Team.

The help documentation and hub about it doesn't include much that is actionable, even if they say it does. It just makes people spin their wheels. In addition to the documentation, the three other recommendations that get copied/pasted into forums, etc. to gain orders results in more wheel spinning: 1. Share your Gigs on social media to attract new buyers (that's called spamming, probably people who aren't even interested in your services to begin with) 2. Engage with the community by participating in the Fiverr Forum (the forum is dead and mostly sellers looking for orders) 3. Regularly update or edit your Gigs to keep them fresh (editing regularly decreases gig visibility) Also, the copy-paste (or AI) responses Fiverr Support provides if you email them aren't helpful; they direct you to the unhelpful resources mentioned above.

But recently, I came across a freelancer who did a terrible job. I honestly told the freelancer that the work was very poor, and she offered a refund. After this, the freelancer lied in the review, claiming I kept the work without paying. That is clearly not an opinion — it’s a lie and goes against Fiverr’s terms and conditions. Still, Fiverr refused to remove the review and only replied with canned messages saying it reflects the user’s opinion. In short: they allow low-quality freelancers to lie about their clients, and Fiverr doesn’t verify anything. Very bad experience with the platform. I don’t recommend it. UPDATE: They use the same canned messages here in Trustpilot, to make as if they care, but they do nothing in fact. I KNOW THEY REPLIED TO MY TICKET AND THAT'S WHY I WAS COMPLAINING. They replied to me with a canned message, saying it was an opinion of the freelancer, not checking any fact and allowing the freelancer to lie. As mentioned before, most freelancers in Fiverr work well, but Fiverr itself is a very bad company, they don't even apply their terms and policies agains false facts and lies.

You should help the seller get an idea where he messed his communication or any part of the service - you should inform him about the order that had a bad impact and good impact on the seller's success score. Also, there are a lot of false negative assumption done by success score criteria when it comes to writing services Reply from Fiverr Hi Maryam, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. When it comes to how it works, the success score metric evaluates each of your Gigs in key areas related to the order process and your relationship with clients, with the history of each Gig examined to determine a score, relative to other freelancers. Ratings, reviews, and feedback is one of many indicators used, not the only thing. The key areas evaluated include client satisfaction, effective communication, conflict-free orders, order cancellations, delivery time, value for money.To improve the areas with a negative impact, take a look at the tips provided in the article linked below, along with the resources available on your dashboard and by contacting our Support Team.

Whether you’re making purchases or trying to sell, everything is broken. Everything. Trying to use Fiverr Pro? You’re forced to make a whole new account. Why can’t you have a Fiverr Pro account and still be a seller? All the purchases I made from my seller account don’t carry over—no points, no history, nothing. Switching back and forth between accounts is tedious, buggy, and glitchy. The chatbot is completely useless as a virtual assistant. Refunds take over a week. The seller fees are outrageous for buyers and even worse for sellers. This greedy, monstrous company has ruined freelancing. Everything goes wrong—it’s a constant struggle. Support? Useless. You think they help? They’re just vermin under the rule of some corporate shill who destroyed the freelance market. This company should implode, and someone needs to build a better freelance platform. Upwork is decent but more for part-time or long-term hires.

I have never seen such unprofessional work and some one with no regard for the order time they have set forfourth. repeatedly this seller would claim that the project was finished and didn't even do anymore work on the project when I asked to the support team to look over just our conversations alone for how the project was going they would just ask me for more proof. The system is set up that if you don't keep housing your seller to complete the tasks it just marked as complete without any background check on the progress or an email to make sure the buyer is satisfied with the work. I had my airtable bases 90% complete and needed a couple of automations to finish it off. one was as simple as an email automation and the seller though it was ok to have the emails being sent to my clients with incomplete information and constant #error written all over the final product that was being sent out. if a seller puts the product as a 2 day completion and it gets to over 10 days. Their should be a level of refund or some level of repercussions. The simple automations were never finished and now the airtable base is a mess. so I will go back to drawing board and redo the project again and look into chatgpt to help finish off the work. although now I've missed my launch deadline. its not just the money I paid to the selling and to the App that was lost.

You would think this would be the perfect platform for this since it seems silly to pay money for a brick and mortar service when a qualified professional could do the same work from home and pocket more of the money, right? 4 attempts to hire a qualified architect and all 4 were scams. They have no vetting process and many freelances obtain 5 star reviews by completing other simple tasks, then embellishing their resume to take on higher paying tasks. You may see an Architect with 20 five star reviews for editing a book, for example. Pretty misleading. Customer service almost seems to enable this behavior. Fiverr gets paid even if they scam you. First of all I would not even recommend trying to use this service. If you ended up in a scam situation like I did 4 times in a row, do not accept the work before looking it over. Many of the freelancers are using AI to just throw together a set of plans or a document and actually have no idea what they are doing. There were so many errors in the plan sets I received I thought it was some sort of sick joke. I ended up missing a deadline and lost a client. Thanks Fiverr. Brenda responded to this.

They shared a high-quality animation as their “original work,” which turned out not to be theirs. I later discovered the same video was being used by multiple other Fiverr sellers. The video I received was significantly lower quality and clearly not the same style. I provided extensive evidence to Fiverr support, including screenshots of the seller admitting they couldn’t animate humans (despite the sample video featuring them), and proof the portfolio video had been falsely claimed. I also showed that the original $750 order was \"mistakenly\" marked \"delivered\" before requirements or deliverables were submitted. Despite clear evidence of deception, Fiverr refused to refund the full amount. They offered partial cancellation and platform credit, but no acknowledgment of the core issue: the transaction was based on false representation. I’m disappointed in Fiverr’s lack of accountability and failure to protect buyers from fraudulent practices. I hope they take this issue seriously moving forward—for the integrity of the platform and protection of future customers. Background: In March 2025, I engaged a seller on Fiverr (snii_studio) to create a professional animated video for my business. The total charges for the project amounted to $950 — $750 for the original order and two additional payments of $100 each for continued revisions. The seller secured the contract by showcasing a high-quality portfolio video and explicitly claiming it was their original work. I hired the seller under this assumption. After delivery, I discovered: -The portfolio video was not their original work. -Multiple other sellers on Fiverr are using the exact same video as part of their portfolios. -The seller admitted they could not animate humans — despite the example portfolio video including animated humans. -Fiverr’s own policy requires that sellers may only showcase work they have personally created. I provided Fiverr with screenshots of: -The seller claiming the video was theirs. -Our conversation where they contradict this by saying they cannot animate humans. -The same portfolio video shown on multiple other Fiverr profiles. -Fiverr's policy stating that all portfolio work must be original. -The final product delivered to me, which is significantly lower in quality and not stylistically similar to the promised work. -A side-by-side comparison between the example portfolio and what was delivered. Fiverr’s Response: Fiverr customer service initially responded politely but insisted that the original $750 order could not be refunded because it was outside their 14-day cancellation window. However, this 14-day period began when the order was mistakenly marked as “complete” in March 20— despite the seller admitting I had not submitted requirements or approved any delivery at that time. I had not even received the video yet by the time Fiverr is claiming my \"14-day window\" happened. I was not able to request a refund during the 14-day window because I was not even aware of the issue yet, and hadn't received the video yet. I finally received the video April 20, and contacted support on April 23, so within a reasonable window of time. Furthermore, they refused to refund the original $750, and only offered to refund the two $100 payments (for revisions), and suggest other freelancers to “fix” the low-quality video. This resolution is unacceptable for the following reasons: -The project was fundamentally based on false advertising and misrepresentation. -The delivered video is not salvageable due to its poor quality and incorrect animation style. -We were misled from the beginning, and thus, the basis for any payment is invalid. -We never received the work that was promised. I have repeatedly asked Fiverr to escalate the issue beyond their support supervisors, and have yet to receive a satisfactory resolution.

This company is a literal joke with fake buyer protection) If you’re reading this, don’t make the mistake I did. I paid a Fiverr “expert” to build a Shopify theme — Order FO attached for this joke company. Not only did the freelancer vanish after promising small post-delivery help, but they also delivered a theme so poorly built that even basic edits in Shopify’s editor break the layout or cause the site to glitch out. No warnings, no flexibility, and absolutely zero accountability. I reached out multiple times — the freelancer read my messages and completely ghosted me for over 10 days. Fiverr’s support? Three different agents passed me around like a hot potato, ignored the video proof I sent of the theme breaking, and offered me a 10% coupon as if that would fix the mess. This isn’t about post-order favors — it’s about a product that flat-out does not work properly, and Fiverr’s refusal to stand behind it. Their “buyer protection” is a joke once the order is marked complete. Even if what you received is broken, they’ll shrug and say “well, you accepted it.” At this point, I’m filing a chargeback with my bank. Fiverr has made it clear that their sellers can ghost you, break your website, and walk away with your money — no consequences.

Fiverr has always leaned heavily in favor of buyers, often at the expense of the very freelancers who power the platform. Support responses feel generic and scripted, and it's clear that seller concerns are rarely given real attention. The updated review system fails to recognize hard work, long-term loyalty, or seniority, making it increasingly difficult for experienced sellers to thrive. On top of that, the growing reliance on AI is changing the platform in a way that feels impersonal and disconnected from the original spirit of freelance collaboration. Fiverr is no longer the supportive environment it once was, and for many seasoned professionals, building your own client base outside the platform may now be the better option.

We will be sure to share your feedback on ways we can enhance the success score metric, as well as our ratings, reviews, and feedback feature.

Ratings, reviews, and feedback is one of many indicators used, not the only thing. The key areas evaluated include client satisfaction, effective communication, conflict-free orders, order cancellations, delivery time, value for money.

We can certainly understand how upsetting it can be when a buyer doesn't place an order. Please always make sure that they do before working on the service that they request. We also understand how important it is for your Gigs to get noticed and to get orders. Here are a few tips that might help: 1. Share your Gigs on social media to attract new buyers. 2. Engage with the community by participating in the Fiverr Forum at https://community.fiverr.com/forums/ 3. Regularly update or edit your Gigs to keep them fresh.

But when I eventually had an issue with a seller. I wanted a refund and when I contacted support they told me “Work it out with the seller” So I tried to and the seller did not want to offer a refund. So the works I received were completely unusable. So I did a chargeback. Well if you don’t read the terms of use like no one does. You will find out that you will have your account restricted for 60 days. Which means you cannot order anything and once your current orders finish you are locked out from messaging people. I contacted support to see if they will offer me protection and get me a refund. They claim exactly “We cannot look into the situation farther until the chargebacks are resolved” So then I proceed to ask can you look at my situation because If I cancel the chargebacks I cannot restart the same case. So four years and over 20k spent. They refuse to help me. So I have moved to upwork and have messaged the sellers I had good experiences with and they are willing to work directly with me. So I do come out the other end. This review is to help those who are looking at this website so they can be prepared. Hope this helps. Update 5/18/2025 Fiverr are still unwilling to protect buyers on their platform. I was given the run around for weeks and then all of a sudden my account is deleted. I can no longer sign in to fiverr and have an email about the account being deleted for TOS breach. They won’t protect you and they will ban you for doing a chargeback AVOID AT ALL COST!

After waiting the standard 14-day clearing period, the money just disappeared from my dashboard. Last month, I completed two more orders—$70 and $10. Same story. After the funds cleared, I saw nothing. Meanwhile, I’m using Promoted Gigs, which Fiverr charges me for out of my own earnings. In two months, I only got three orders through ads, and after Fiverr’s cuts and ad fees, I ended up with zero income despite doing all the work. And the most outrageous part? Fiverr makes freelancers wait 14 days to access cleared payments—and then has the audacity to offer “Early Payout” for a fee of $25 (previously $19). That’s right: they withhold your money and charge you to get it faster. Compare that to Upwork, where freelancers get access to their funds in just 5 business days—no extra fees required. Fiverr is the only platform I know where: • You lose 20% of every order • You pay for ads that rarely convert • You wait two weeks for payments • You get nothing if fees eat up your earnings • You’re offered faster payouts—but only if you pay them more This isn’t freelancing empowerment. This is daylight robbery in a digital disguise. Fiverr must do better—for the freelancers who built this platform with their time, talent, and trust.

I am writing to respectfully appeal the recent deactivation of my Fiverr account. I have been providing services on Fiverr for over three years with full dedication and professionalism. Recently, one of my key team members (a developer who handles the majority of the technical orders) was hospitalized due to a serious medical emergency. I have attached the hospital report for your reference. Unfortunately, during this period, I missed an important message from a buyer which, due to the platform’s spam filtering, did not appear in my main inbox. As a result, I was unable to respond in time, and the order was canceled. The project was already completed and involved a cost of approximately $1500 in time and resources. Due to this cancellation and the account suspension, I have also lost direct clients and ongoing business opportunities. I completely understand the importance of maintaining communication and timely deliveries, and I sincerely apologize for the disruption caused. I kindly request you to review my case and consider reactivating my account, as this was an unfortunate and unforeseen medical emergency. I am willing to provide any further documentation needed and would deeply appreciate your understanding and support. Thank you for your time and consideration.

My account was permanently disabled on allegations of “multiple accounts,” even though I explained multiple times that my husband and I are two separate ACCA-qualified professionals, each maintaining independent Fiverr accounts, different devices, different emails, and separate payment methods. Fiverr closed my account without properly investigating the reality, despite providing legal documents like National ID cards and ACCA membership certificates. This decision has severely affected my career, income, and professional reputation. I have always adhered to Fiverr’s guidelines, maintained high client satisfaction, and respected the platform’s community standards. Unfortunately, Fiverr’s Trust & Safety team has been unresponsive to factual evidence, and their decisions seem automated without individual case review. I am highly disappointed with how such a professional platform can mishandle genuine sellers’ accounts without due process. I respectfully urge Fiverr to implement a more transparent and fair review process to protect honest professionals in the future.

Here's how it goes: A buyer places an order, and I deliver the work as agreed. Instead of accepting the delivery, they keep hitting \"Request Revision\" over and over, even when the work is perfectly fine. Their feedback is often vague – things like, “check again” or “something’s missing,” leaving me guessing what they really want. I revise again and again, only for them to request more changes, all in an attempt to avoid closing the project. Eventually, the seller either begs to accept or they’ll cancel the order just to get rid of the open project. And what do they get in the end? Free work and a full refund. This is a major flaw in Fiverr’s system. As a seller, I’m stuck in an endless loop of revisions or risk having the order canceled without any proper resolution. There’s no accountability for buyers abusing the system, and it feels like I’m working for free. I’m tired of wasting countless hours on these never-ending cycles, and I’m sure other sellers are facing the same issue. Fiverr needs to set clearer boundaries around revisions and protect sellers from this kind of exploitation. Reply from Fiverr Hi Samantha, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

Shame on this platform and who's running it. Reply from Fiverr Hello Eliya, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We're sorry to hear about your experience.

Reply from Fiverr Hi Ibrahim, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We can certainly imagine how important it is to get orders. Here are a few tips that might help: 1. Share your Gigs on social media to attract new buyers. 2. Engage with the community by participating in the Fiverr Forum at https://community.fiverr.com/forums/ 3. Regularly update or edit your Gigs to keep them fresh.

She has over 5000 reviews that are good but like me I'm sure most would want to take their reviews back once they learn that her tutorials are out dated and her employees don't care as much as they need to about the service they're supposed to provide. It's a scam. The bad thing about Fiverr is if you find out that you've been dupped 14 days after the works done there isn't much you can do. You can't take back your 5 stars. You can't complain because there's no one to complain to. You can't get a refund.

When I contacted customer service for a refund, they were unresponsive and eventually stopped replying completely. They took my money for a service I couldn't access due to their technical issues, then refused to make it right. I've had to file complaints with my credit card company, the FTC and the Better Business Bureau. Completely unprofessional business practices. Save yourself the frustration and look elsewhere. UPDATE: Fiverr did finally refund my $20 and I am grateful for that. But only after I posted here and filed a complaint with the BBB. I really wish Fiverr's customer service had been more responsive from the beginning and been willing to work with me like any other reputable business would have. I'm not sure if this is a result of human error or an AI bot simply following procedure. It's a shame I am no longer able to use the platform when my situation could have easily been resolved quickly and differently.

I spent weeks appealing to Fiverr’s support, providing evidence (code, docs, screenshots), but they dismissed me, citing the client’s “loss of trust” and a policy that supposedly prevents use of my work—yet they offer no enforcement. Fiverr’s system fails freelancers. Approved work can be retroactively cancelled if a client complains, leaving you unpaid while clients profit. I lost 110 hours, domain costs, and trust in Fiverr. Avoid this platform unless you want to risk working for free. I’m sharing this to warn others and urge Fiverr to fix their unfair policies. *Answer to Fiverr's response: Fiverr’s response ignores that my approved milestone was cancelled and offers no solution. Their ‘policy’ on work usage is unenforceable, leaving freelancers unpaid. Reply from Fiverr Hi Robin, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We're sorry to hear about your experience.

I followed their instructions, clearly stated that I use legal paid ads through platforms like Facebook and Google, and made sure everything was transparent and compliant. What did they do next? They shut down my entire account without any proper explanation. No warning, no clear reason, and zero professional communication. Here’s the real issue: Fiverr still allows the \"Web Traffic\" category. It’s right there on the site, and people are offering the exact same service I was. So how does that make sense? You offer a category, then punish sellers for using it legally? And the money left in my account? No one even bothered to explain how or when it will be released. Am I supposed to wait months? Or are they just planning to keep it? That’s not just bad support — it feels like outright theft. I followed the rules, did everything right, and got treated like I broke some policy they won’t even explain. One star is too generous.

First, I hired an English teacher for a two-hour class. The session was completely disorganized, and she clearly wasn’t qualified. I canceled after the first hour and asked for a refund for the remaining time. She agreed—but never sent the refund. I tried contacting Fiverr support, but there was no real way to get help. Then I hired someone to create a GoFundMe campaign. She didn’t do anything. I had already set up the account myself, wrote the script on my own, and even had to pay someone else to create the video. She contributed absolutely nothing yet still kept my money. When I asked for a refund, she just told me to contact the platform—knowing very well it’s hard to get any resolution. Unfortunately, this feels like a scam. Too many sellers are not delivering what they promise, and Fiverr offers no real support to protect buyers. Be cautious—many people on the platform are not professionals, and you might end up wasting your money. Reply from Fiverr Hi Mardochee, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

The current level system feels unfair, especially for sellers who provide quality work but don’t hit the earning target due to lower-priced gigs . Also, Fiverr takes a $1 cut from every $5 order, and charges both the buyer and seller. That’s a high commission, especially for new freelancers who are trying to grow. We put in a lot of effort, and it feels discouraging when we lose a big chunk of income on each order.

Recently, I was contacted by an individual through a freelance website called Fiverr. After the initial conversation on the platform, this person requested to continue the payment process via email. They then directed me to an external website for payment. On this website, I was asked to provide my personal details and card information. They stated that this information was necessary to confirm my bank details and register my account in their payment system, so that I could receive payment for my services. At that point, this seemed normal to me, as it's common in freelance work to verify identity and account details before receiving payments. They also claimed that no funds would be withdrawn from my account — that this step was only to confirm that there were sufficient funds available to proceed with the transaction. However, shortly after submitting my information, money was withdrawn from my account. When I questioned this, the individual insisted that I needed to send more money to complete a second verification. They claimed that the full amount — along with the payment for my services — would be refunded afterward. I now realize this was likely a scam. I have attached screenshots and relevant information regarding the interaction. I kindly suggest for people to be careful with this plataform and for the platafor to investigate this matter urgently and let me know if any steps can be taken to recover mine funds.

Recently, I had a very frustrating experience with a dishonest client. I delivered everything as agreed — I created a Facebook page, an Instagram page, and even an Outlook email. After completing the order, the client suddenly asked me to create a Gmail account instead. I politely explained that Gmail requires a phone number and requested his number to proceed. Instead of providing it, he asked me to cancel the order. I agreed to the cancellation just to avoid conflict, even though the work was already done. Later, the client left a false 1-star review claiming I didn’t do any work, which was completely untrue. I reached out to Fiverr support with proof of the work delivered and explained everything clearly. Unfortunately, their only response was that they “can’t remove reviews,” even when they are clearly misleading and damaging to a seller’s reputation. As a freelancer who values transparency and professionalism, it’s really disappointing to see Fiverr ignore cases where sellers are being exploited. This kind of review system can easily be abused and has a serious impact on honest sellers trying to build their reputation. I hope Fiverr takes seller protection more seriously in the future.

As the deadline is fairly tight I contacted 4-5 freelancers. 3 of them said they couldn't take the project on, I thanked them and never messaged them again. One didn't get back to me, and with another we started discussing the project and whether they'd be willing to take it on and how to go about it. At no point did I try to get their direct details, shared mine, do anything dodgy or anything like that. I shared a couple of small and simple image files with them for reference in the fiverr chat. Suddenly I get booted off mid-conversation and when I try and log back in I get a message that my account had been disabled. I send support an inquiry, befuddled, and this is what I get in response: \"Your account was permanently disabled due to violations of our guidelines: contacting other users with unsolicited offers, suggestions, phishing, malware, or anything unrelated to their Gigs or orders is prohibited.\" We had done no such thing, we're a serious business looking for a contractor. Now imagine being in the middle of an engagement on fiverr, you've deposited funds, the deadline is looming, you're working with a freelancer and you get booted off. I think the initial mail actually said \"soz but all the money in your account is now forfeit\". Luckily we never got to this point, but did dodge a bullet. This is not a serious platform, I suggest you avoid it unless your project is of a hobbyist nature or something and can risk such randomness.

They just dismissed me and gave me some generic language about their policy of multiple accounts, which didn't apply to me, and also warned me not to make another account. Strange way to treat a customer who is trying to do business through them! My main problem is the way they went about it. I can always get my job done elsewhere and another service will be happy to take my money. The issue for me was that there was no warning or helpful explanation of the issue, just a blanket suspension and warning not to contact customer service... which felt very dismissive, accusatory, and insulting.

I provided all the content, the structure, and just needed someone to format it properly with a clean layout and some decent stock images. That’s it. What I got looked like something built after watching a YouTube tutorial for an hour — a generic Wix template with text dumped in, no design thought, and stock images that had no relevance at all. It was so bad, I honestly couldn’t believe the seller thought it was acceptable to deliver. And when I asked for it to be improved, I was told that would “cost extra.” At that point, I started looking more closely at their glowing reviews — and red flags started flying. Some of the sites don’t exist. One review referred to a totally different name. It made me seriously question how genuine the feedback really was. Fiverr didn’t refund me — the seller cancelled the order themselves once they realised I’d rumbled them. That says it all. Fiverr looks like a platform full of trusted, skilled freelancers, but the truth is: anyone can create a slick profile, claim to be an expert, and start taking money, even if they’re just learning the basics. And I have since learned that there is a way to manipulate reviews between each other. Unless Fiverr introduces better vetting and more transparent review systems, it will continue to be a “buyer beware” platform — especially for anyone needing real quality. I could say, a lot more about this experience, I had with this seller, that instantly raised huge red flags, but I won't bore anyone. I have had some great work done as well off Fiverr in the past, unfortunately at this time, my experience is the site suddenly has an awful lot of scammers professing to be experts or have a true talent when they clearly have none. Thankfully today I have realised how to check a true review to ensure it's not fake, But should I need to do this... Is this not the job of a Fiverr staff member. Surely it should be there job to spot these practices and keep their site safe. I would like to follow up on this review... The seller has disappeared from Fiverr, either he has realised he has been rumbled or my concerns to Fiverr where taken seriously and they took swift action. Be aware of sellers with sudden video reviews from people, all claiming they had amazing work done... They are mostly fake. This is a reg flag to begin with. Also reviews with too much praise all sounding the same and over praising.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=66","page_number":66},{"reviewer_name":"GIDEON KEHINDE JOHN","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/67f4e694d5878172e7cae875","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"GK","date":null,"star_rating":"1","review_text":"@fiverr I have been on your platform as a seller and can't have any order.Why?

They haven't confirmed if there'd be a limit on how many gigs you can put out.

We will be sure to share your feedback on ways we can enhance the success score metric, as well as our ratings, reviews, and feedback feature. When it comes to how it works, the success score metric evaluates each of your Gigs in key areas related to the order process and your relationship with clients, with the history of each Gig examined to determine a score, relative to other freelancers. Ratings, reviews, and feedback is one of many indicators used, not the only thing. The key areas evaluated include client satisfaction, effective communication, conflict-free orders, order cancellations, delivery time, value for money. To improve the areas with a negative impact, take a look at the tips provided in the article linked below, along with the resources available on your dashboard and by contacting our Support Team. This information provides a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to your success score and how you can evaluate your gig for improvements.

Recently, I received an account warning with zero explanation—no violations, no details, just a random penalty. Before this, I had already opened a ticket about a glitched Success Score, but Fiverr ignored it. Now, instead of fixing their mistakes, they punish sellers for no reason. No real support, no transparency, just automated responses and unfair penalties. If you’re a seller, beware—Fiverr can flag your account anytime without justification, and their support won’t help. This platform does not respect its freelancers. I’ve had it. Until they fix their broken system and actually communicate like professionals, I can’t recommend Fiverr to anyone.

I'm a seller on Fiverr, I followed a buyers brief exactly and submitted content that was in line with my other work. The buyer came back wanting me to redo the entire video because they wanted different lighting, which was not discussed beforehand, but did not want to pay a revision fee so they withdrew the revision request and completed the order. A few days later they came back telling me to redo it. I emailed customer service for help and they told me to stay within my gigs guidelines but to try to work something out and that if the order was cancelled they would review it since I followed the brief, so I offered to switch out a few things for free or they could order a new video. They offered me $30 for a new video (my price is $150) I emailed support again for help and they got back to me on my day off telling me to \"communicate with the buyer\" Then they refunded and canceled the order before I got back to work the next day. When I emailed support again to ask why it was cancelled before I could work something out, I got an extremely rude support agent who told me I refused to consider his advice about communicating with the buyer and therefore I will not be compensated. The reason why I did not communicate was because it was my day off. I explained this, and the agent then told me that that wasn't the problem, that the problem was I didn't follow the brief, which I absolutely had. I asked to escalate to another support agent for review and he said no. I'm having a horrible time dealing with this support person, I feel like I'm being bullied by him, he's blocking me from getting ahold of someone who can actually review the order, and I'm not getting any actual help or review of my deliverable. They took my money even though I delivered everything that was asked for in the initial brief. Horrific experience. Reply from Fiverr Hello Elliot, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

I have used Fiverr for several months and 1 out of 2 of every service purchase have been from bad to worst.

I’ve contacted support multiple times and even received a response from a supervisor. But when I asked some basic and honest questions, they completely stopped replying. Here’s what I asked them: What proof do you require from me to clear my name? How can I prove to you that I had no link to any fake order? You can check the orders—I delivered exactly what the client requested. If the orders were fake, why didn’t Fiverr cancel them in the first place? Why wasn’t the buyer held accountable? Why is it always the seller who suffers? How is a seller supposed to know if an order is real or fake? I never got an answer to any of these questions. Fiverr talks about supporting freelancers, but in reality, they give no protection to sellers. I spent 8 years building my profile, worked hard, and followed all the rules. My gig was already ranking on the first page, so I had no reason to fake anything. Still, my account was banned without warning or a fair investigation, and now they’ve gone silent when I ask valid questions. If you’re a seller on Fiverr, be warned—they can disable your account at any time, and you won’t get a chance to explain. ----_-------------------- I worked on Fiverr for eight years, building my profile and delivering quality work to clients. My gig was ranking on the first page, and everything was going great—until Fiverr suddenly disabled my account over an alleged “fake order.” I never placed any fake orders, and as a seller, I have no control over who orders my services. I was never given a chance to explain my side, and Fiverr just removed my account without any real investigation. After all the time and effort I put in, they didn’t even bother to listen. It’s frustrating how Fiverr doesn’t stand by its sellers. They preach about supporting freelancers, but in reality, they can take everything away without warning. If you’re thinking of investing years into this platform, just know that they can shut you down overnight, and there’s nothing you can do about it.

Oh, AND If you choose to transfer your funds from Fiverr to a bank account instead of PayPal, Fiverr processor for that transaction also charges a fee.

I reported the issue immediately, but after two days, I still haven’t received any support, while the buyer was able to open a dispute in just a few hours. What’s even worse? Fiverr expects me to pay €20/month for Fiverr Plus just to receive proper support. So unless I pay extra, I have no protection against scammers? This is outrageous. Sellers are the backbone of this platform, yet Fiverr treats us as disposable while bending over backward for buyers, even those who violate policies. This system is rigged against sellers, making it easy for dishonest buyers to exploit artists, request free work, and abuse the dispute process. Fiverr should be ashamed of how it handles seller protection—this is not a fair marketplace, it’s a buyer’s paradise at the expense of hardworking freelancers.

This is client poaching and manipulation, plain and simple. When I called him out, he just blocked me to avoid accountability.

Even a small issue can lead to account suspension or gig de-ranking, making it extremely difficult for sellers to grow. Fiverr's 20% commission on every order is also quite high, especially considering that sellers do all the hard work. While Fiverr provides a great marketplace for freelancers, the lack of seller support and strict policies make it challenging for freelancers to sustain their business in the long run. I hope Fiverr considers making its system fairer for both parties. Reply from Fiverr Hi Musab, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We're sorry to hear about your experience.

As a seller, it's incredibly difficult to find business in a market that is saturated, without pricing yourself into the ground (even if you're a professional) and then even with perfect ratings you can't advance to the next level of selling without earning $400 on the platform which, as I'm sure you can imagine, is inordinately hard when you're pricing yourself down to get orders. Keep in mind that there are others on the platform doing exactly the same thing. Along with having to reduce your prices to get orders, fiver also takes a 20% cut of all of your earnings, on top of also charging that buyer a service fee of their own, which is utter daylight robbery, in my opinion. For buyers, as well as the top sellers - I'm sure it's a great platform but for the small guys, like me. Even with an unfaultering 5-star rating, after 7 years, I haven't even progressed to fiverr's first selling level. Reply from Fiverr Hello Mitchell, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We can certainly imagine how difficult it must be to get orders and we wish to share with you some tips: 1. Share your Gigs on social media to attract new buyers. 2. Engage with the community by participating in the Fiverr Forum at https://community.fiverr.com/forums/ 3. Regularly update or edit your Gigs to keep them fresh. To help guide your pricing, we recommend reviewing the rates offered by other freelancers providing similar services. This can give you a better sense of the current market trends. Additionally, if a buyer places an order and requests extra work, you have the option to send them a custom offer to accommodate their needs. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or need assistance.

Most of the times you will just spend time chatting with people who \"lost their profile\" and want to use yours for their work, so you will be getting some 100 - 1000 USD monthly for nothing... (not sure whether they have any antimoney laundering policies in place, but by siding to the scammers it does not seem so...) EDIT: Answer to reply: What is the benefit of me looking for customers myself, do all the job, marketing etc and at the end tell them: oh by the way it would be great to give a huge part of what you pay to fiverr... and later fiverr is going to cancel the order as they just did to me, so I don´t get paid at all... Sorry, but a big NO... I won´t be trying hard to only see that fiverr is working hard against me trying to kill my profile completely...

In the span of just a week and a half, I have placed multiple orders and have faced nothing but delays, unprofessionalism, and complete failure to deliver from multiple sellers—all while Fiverr does little to protect buyers. Order 1: The Wix Website Disaster I hired a seller to build a Wix website, and not only did they fail to improve it, they actually made it worse. Random text was left all over the site, and despite their claims of \"working on it,\" I knew this was a lie because I had removed their admin access. For an entire day, the seller deceived me, pretending to be working while doing nothing. When confronted, they begged for payment and even resorted to guilt-tripping me, claiming they had \"mental issues\" to pressure me into paying for a job they didn't do. Order 2: Video Project Delayed Until It Was Too Late I placed an order for a video advertisement, making it clear from the start that I needed it urgently. The seller fully understood my urgency yet waited until the final delivery day to inform me they couldn’t do it—when it was too late for me to find an alternative. Instead of taking accountability, they insisted on refunding the order, knowing that Fiverr does not allow reviews on canceled orders—which conveniently protected their reputation. I even offered a compromise, asking the seller to create a simple carousel post instead so my business wouldn't be completely stalled. This was point-blank refused. The seller falsely claimed I was \"making threats\" simply because I suggested moving forward with a smaller, cheaper job instead of outright canceling. It became very clear that they preferred to raise a refund solely to prevent me from leaving a public review. Order 3: Another Seller, Another Last-Minute Failure In an attempt to move forward, I found another seemingly reputable seller to create social media advertisement videos. Yet again, they waited until the delivery date to admit they couldn’t fulfill the order because they lacked the required footage—something they should have told me upfront. This repeated pattern of last-minute cancellations and wasted time has now left my business in a severely vulnerable position. Fiverr's Deeply Flawed Refund System & Buyer Protection Issues After dealing with multiple failed projects, I managed to secure refunds totaling hundreds of pounds. However, Fiverr does not refund money back to the original payment method. Instead, the funds are trapped in my Fiverr balance, making it extremely difficult and inconvenient to access. I now have to find the time to figure out how to withdraw my own money, which should never have been this complicated in the first place. The reality is, Fiverr's system protects bad sellers at the expense of buyers: ✔️ Sellers stall and waste buyers' time until it's too late to find alternatives. ✔️ Fiverr doesn’t allow public reviews on canceled orders, allowing unreliable sellers to continue misleading others. ✔️ Sellers rush to issue refunds instead of offering solutions—just to avoid negative reviews. ✔️ Buyers are left with nothing after days or weeks of waiting, while Fiverr pockets transaction fees and keeps refunds locked in Fiverr balance. Fiverr Needs to Fix This, or Businesses Like Mine Will Walk Away for Good I run a business, and Fiverr has cost me time, money, and opportunities due to its lack of seller accountability. This platform needs to change—whether that means allowing public reviews on canceled orders, improving seller vetting, or fixing its broken refund system. Right now, Fiverr is not a platform I can trust, and I strongly urge business owners to think twice before relying on it for anything critical.

I've been trying to resolve an issue with a refund of €66.54 for days, and the support team, including Billy, Kayla, and Dave, has been completely incompetent and ignorant in handling the case. I clearly paid €847.07, but they only refunded €780.53, leaving a difference of €66.54 that they refuse to acknowledge. The main issue is that Fiverr keeps justifying the discrepancy with exchange rate fluctuations, even though I paid and received the invoice in euros, not dollars. I've sent them screenshots of the charges and invoices in euros, but they keep giving generic and evasive responses about currency exchange and USD balance. The worst part is the lack of consistency and professionalism: every response comes from a different person (Kayla, Dave, and Billy), all saying the same thing without properly reviewing the details of the case. This lack of coordination and basic understanding of international transactions shows that either they are scamming customers or they simply have no idea how currencies and refunds work. If they don’t refund the money in the next few hours, I will proceed to dispute the charge with my bank and report this fraudulent practice to the authorities. Fiverr has proven to be a non-transparent platform with terrible customer service. I DO NOT recommend Fiverr to anyone who values their time and money.

Lots of generic and Ai responses! I once paid someone to creatively come up with book titles for a book I was writing. I gave them other titles I liked, my story's theme and outline and such. What did I get in return? A list of random titles that weren't even related to my story or creative at all! It's like they just googled \"book title list\" and sent it to me. Another time I hired someone to read my story and provide feedback, it read like CHATGPT and was very vague thus unhelpful. Recently I hired sometime to read and provide feedback for a 10k word short story. After a week I expected it to be done. It was late even after I gave an extension! This seems very unprofessional. I don't think I'll use this site again. No more editors or beta readers for my self published books I guess. Reply from Fiverr Hello there, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

As a professional way to work, he's a real disappointment. It is not the first time I work with him, and I did it again because I thought maybe he wouldn't repeat the same mistakes. Last time, I repeated writing about 5 or 6 times the details I wanted, ending in a logo I was supposed to have in few days, it took him about 2 weeks to deliver because he just doesn't take time to read. But gave a good review anyway thinking it won't happen again, and that at the end I was so pleased with the logo. I ordered him another logo, same issue again : I always and more than once given the exact details of what I want, but he just keeps not reading. And the worse part is that he doesn't work on his own (he said more than once something that is not done). Personally, I think it is precisely because there seems to be more than one person that there is the problem, or that the seller has changed. The very fist time I contacted this seller, the name was @logographic (he had a light bulb as profile picture 💡), and everything was perfect : he delivered me a very good logo, and without repeating mistakes. I don't know if the seller @Samiullah is same or different one as @logographic I work with before, but it is only when I said that I was going to complain that he delivered my logo as I wanted. And even then, at the end when finishing the project, I had again to repeat about 3 times (which I already did before) that I needed the logo in transparent background so my web designer can use it And it is not about how beautiful a logo is as obviously there are others sellers, it is about being serious working. Please Fiverr, in might not be a good idea in my opinion more than one seller in one seller's name. It is not misunderstandinds when the seller has been given repeatedly and precisely all the details. That was a stressful experience.

As an artist, I was looking forward to offering my services and bringing joy to clients through my work. However, I was banned from selling on the platform solely because of my nationality. I do not live in Russia, I do not support the Russian government, and I do not contribute to the Russian economy in any way. In fact, I had to leave my country due to political persecution. Despite all this, Fiverr has decided that my passport alone is a valid reason to exclude me from their marketplace. This is an outrageous violation of basic human rights and a clear example of hypocrisy and discrimination. Fiverr claims to be an inclusive platform, yet it enforces collective punishment against individuals based on nationality, regardless of their beliefs, values, or circumstances. This policy is not only unfair but also completely illogical. How does banning an independent artist, who has fled an authoritarian regime, contribute to any meaningful political change? How does preventing me from making a living through art align with Fiverr’s supposed commitment to diversity and inclusion? I urge everyone to be aware of Fiverr’s discriminatory practices. If you believe in fairness, human rights, and true inclusivity, think twice before using this platform. Reply from Fiverr Hi Polina, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

When I needed help, Fiverr ignored me for days—over 72 hours on two separate occasions. They only responded after I went public on social media. When I called them out, Fiverr admitted to delays but still refused to refund me, claiming my \"benefits\" were active for 48+ hours. What benefits? The 5-hour support I paid for never happened! Fiverr forces sellers to refund clients when they \"fail to deliver.\" But when Fiverr itself fails? No refunds, no accountability, just excuses. They mislead sellers, ignore support requests, and refuse refunds when they blatantly fail to provide what they advertised. If you're considering Seller Plus, don’t waste your money. Key Issues: False Advertising – 5-hour support was never delivered. Ignored for Days – Only responded when I exposed them. Double Standards – Sellers must refund when they fail, but Fiverr doesn’t. No Accountability – Just excuses and refusal to refund. I’ve already reported Fiverr to multiple consumer protection agencies, including the FTC and BBB, for false advertising. If you’ve been scammed too, speak up! EDIT Just amazing! Fiverr couldn't go even lower! After reading this review they replied making people believe they solved my case, instead of replying my emails that was being ghosted for more than 10 days, they simply close the ticket without even reply and then comes here to lie about it!

I sent another message saying what he said for me to do don't work he turned off his messages.. I looked online scammed by fiverr freelancer and alot of people have been scammed. They will not give a refund after telling them your situation you do better find someone else for the job. Don't waste your time and money on this site because you won't get your money back.

However, I later discovered that the service was fraudulent and had stopped working. When I contacted Fiverr to update my review and report the issue, they informed me that it was not possible to modify my feedback. Fiverr takes no accountability for scams occurring on its platform, allowing dishonest freelancers to continue deceiving buyers. Their lack of a review update mechanism and failure to protect users from fraudulent sellers make the platform highly unreliable. I strongly advise caution when using Fiverr, as many freelancers operate dishonestly, and the platform does little to address such issues.

Instead of addressing my concern about the account flag, they sent a generic reply about gig rankings and impressions, which had nothing to do with my issue. This shows a serious lack of customer support and transparency. A professional support team should provide clear communication, actionable solutions, and genuine assistance. Instead, Fiverr’s response felt automated and dismissive, leaving me frustrated and without answers. Sellers who rely on this platform for their livelihood deserve better support and accountability.

I hired a freelancer to help me with a task I couldn’t figure out due to a lack of time. So, I went on Fiverr to look for someone. I found a freelancer named Anada A and selected the basic service, which was priced at $20. The task was simply to open a port in a firewall—something that, if you truly consider yourself a networking specialist, should take no more than five minutes. This so-called \"networking specialist\" accepted the order, but once it was confirmed, he reached out and demanded more money. This infuriated me because it’s an unethical tactic that takes advantage of customers' needs. It’s not about the money—it’s about respecting what you offer. If you advertise a service at a certain price, you can’t change it after the customer has already placed the order. But that’s exactly what happened. I saw the price was $20, I placed an order, and then he changed the terms. Fiverr should take action against freelancers who list services at low prices just to attract customers, only to later increase the cost unfairly. I had a terrible experience with this freelancer, and I won’t be using this platform anymore. Reply from Fiverr Hi Josue, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

However, my experience took a shocking turn when Fiverr restricted my account unfairly without proper human review. Unjustified Restriction: I received a notification to modify my gig titles, claiming \"bad grammar\" or \"wrong service,\" even though my gig titles were perfectly fine. After making the required changes, Fiverr restricted my account within one minute, claiming it was \"carefully reviewed.\" How can a careful review be done in a single minute? Clearly, this was an automated bot decision, not a real human review. No Clear Explanation: Fiverr failed to provide any specific reason for the ban. I never violated any Fiverr policies, never shared personal details, and all my work was 100% original. Despite my long-standing positive record, they permanently restricted my account without a fair chance to appeal. Poor Customer Support: Fiverr’s support team gives copy-paste responses without addressing the actual issue. There is no real communication, no proper investigation, and no opportunity to clarify misunderstandings. Freelancers Are Not Valued: Fiverr benefits from the hard work of freelancers, yet they treat sellers unfairly by relying on faulty automated systems. Years of dedication, effort, and a strong reputation can be destroyed within minutes without valid reasoning. ⚠️ Freelancers, beware! If you invest time in Fiverr, know that your account can be restricted at any time without a valid reason or human review. Fiverr needs to fix its support system and improve transparency for freelancers who rely on the platform. I do NOT recommend Fiverr to serious freelancers who want a secure and fair working environment. Reply from Fiverr Hi Tushar, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

I now want to share the conclusion of that experience, after hoping for a better outcome. There are several reasons why I feel compelled to write this review. You be the judge! To warn beginners: Be very careful and learn from my costly experience. I lost $1,200, which feels like money gone up in smoke. To inform Fiverr users: If you're on Fiverr or thinking of joining, be aware that you only have 14 days to leave feedback on your editor. I waited, trying not to penalize my editor and hoping to remain professional as always. I gave her, Quata D. Merit, time, hoping to find a compromise. However, I was hit with the 14-day rule, which I wasn’t aware of at the time. That’s why I’m now mentioning her name. I had already informed customer support, telling them I believed she knew what she was doing after all her years on the site. I trusted the reviews and the star rating, and I honestly don’t understand what went wrong. Is the rating system really as reliable as we think? Sadly, I wasn’t wrong, based on my interactions with her. The editor decides what type of editing they will do without informing the writer. I had expected more than one pass at my manuscript, but that wasn’t the case. Fiverr customer support clarified: \"In this case, the freelancer offers a 'deep edit,' which is what they seem to have done for your manuscript.\" Wow—what a deep statement! My editor read my manuscript once and then said goodbye and added “If you want another quote, let me know.\" This was for a 77,000-word manuscript, with many suggested changes, but no follow-up. I never expected the editor to reread the entire manuscript. However, confirming the changes would have been the next logical step, as I read somewhere, before proceeding on Fiverr. I really don’t know what else to say about this experience. Customer service kept asking me what I wanted to do, but I received conflicting answers from different representatives. One would say one thing, the next would say something else. It was unclear why they didn’t mention the 14-day rule from the start. It feels like they were trying to push the matter past the 14-day window, rather than giving me clear information upfront.

If the work performed is of poor quality the contractor will perform and help you until the time for review is lapsed then you will not hear from the contractor. Also, you are given 1-2 days to review the work after it is completed, if you don't review the work delivered within this short timeframe the project will be considered to be complete and the clock for the review will start. I had an experience with a couple of contractors on the platform and typically they are good. However, very often they do not perform, and knowing the system better than you they can get paid and leave you with a bad job while you will not be able to do anything. Can't leave a review and can't dispute. Reply from Fiverr Hello Artem, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We're sorry to hear about your order experience. As you may know after an order is delivered, the buyer has 3 days to review and mark accordingly. If you believe that you need more time to review the order, you can decline it within the 3 day period. If no action is taken, the sytem will approve the order and the buyer will have 14 days to either ask for revisions or request a cancellation. If the freelancer were to become unresponsive during the 14 day period then the buyer can reach out to our Support Team at fvrr.co/help for assistance.

In my case i hired him to build me a mega menu for my Shopify store in which he did and delivered, which I left a 5 star review, however, once I started loading products, I ran into a few problems as the menu expanded. You were not able to see all of the categories on the mobile phone view. I waited weeks while he tried to fix it and then when I asked for a refund so I can hire somebody else to fix it he refused and actually blocked my email so I could no longer contact him. So I went over to customer service, sent them over 40. That is not a miss. Print over forty screenshots of what I asked him to do end his replies that he would fix them along with proof that it was fixed by somebody else, I had to hire and after all that, they refused me a refund. No one thing fiver does not protect the customer at all. As you can see from the many other reviews, it is just repetitive. They do not care about you so heed warning.

Clients end up paying more than the listed price, while sellers receive significantly less due to Fiverr’s high commission.

However, Fiverr’s handling of unfair buyers has completely disappointed me. Recently, a scammer ordered a $5 gig, demanded work worth $100, and after receiving 14 high-quality images, left an unfair negative review without requesting revisions. Despite my perfect record, Fiverr refused to remove the fraudulent review, even though I provided clear proof that my work met the requirements. 🔹 Fiverr’s system protects buyers—even scammers—but offers no real support for sellers. 🔹 There is no proper dispute resolution process for false reviews or bad-faith buyers. 🔹 Fiverr’s customer service responds with generic copy-paste replies, refusing to escalate cases. If Fiverr truly values \"marketplace integrity,\" they should protect honest sellers from abusive buyers who misuse the rating system to get free work.

I started as a buyer and seller in 2015, and became a Level 2 seller over time. Fiverr has now redesigned and removed almost everything good about its platform. It has greedily increased fees for buyers, made the website as boring and ugly as possible with an unnecessary rebrand, and no matter how many new paid programs they add for sellers to \"level up\" their freelancing, they hold no appeal. My organic messages have decreased to almost zero. The level system has changed and despite meeting all the criteria I can barely stay at Level 1 due to the \"gig success\" score which is arbitrary and stupid. Fiverr has become a colossal failure; it's worse to use now for both buyers and sellers. I don't trust Fiverr anymore. I'm extraordinarily disappointed that a once-great platform has turned into such garbage. Reply from Fiverr Hi Anielle, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review and for sharing your experience in regards to the Success Score feature. When it comes to how it works, the success score metric evaluates each of your Gigs in key areas related to the order process and your relationship with clients, with the history of each Gig examined to determine a score, relative to other freelancers. Ratings, reviews, and feedback is one of many indicators used, not the only thing. The key areas evaluated include client satisfaction, effective communication, conflict-free orders, order cancellations, delivery time, value for money. To improve the areas with a negative impact, take a look at the tips provided in the article linked below, along with the resources available on your dashboard and by contacting our Support Team. This information provides a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to your success score and how you can evaluate your gig for improvements.

I have been aware of Fiverr for years and wary of it's place at the bottom of the freelancing heap, and now I know why for good reason. Now my idea of branching out has led me to uncover a huge degree of ineptness and in my opinion systematic manipulation in their business. In setting up my account, I follow the exact steps I have many times before on other platforms. Everything is going fine until I hit their verification step. Firstly, all my details are accepted (UK driving licence, phone number, tax details etc). Now I'll be the first to admit the lighting in my room isn't the best, and this has caused issues before with verification on other platforms. I unfortunately fail this verification with it being unable to see my face clearly, then that's it, no more chances. I think no big deal, I'll reach out to their customer service, a company like this must have a good system in place to solve easy mistakes such as this. With one click of a button like in other sites, they can reset the verification and I can be fully confirmed just a few hours later. Now this is where the sheer audacity of planned ineptness, laziness or straight up terrible customer service/ disregard for a system comes into play. Firstly, I'm very happy to discover they have a live chatbot, like any respectable company with a clientele such as theirs should have. The use of the chatbot is clearly plastered all over their advertising as a KPI of solving queries and getting in contact with a member of their team. Little do people know this is actually impossible. 30 minutes later, infinitely more frustrated and having tried every option, I can see this in an impossibility and is simply there for show. I have taken screenshots and copied the call log to prove this point. It gets to a stage each time with enough prompts to say that it will get you in contact with someone, but this never materialises. This setting simply isn't connected. Now don't get me wrong, this may work for those who have already been verified/ accepted, I haven't checked. But now I wouldn't put it past them to have something like this hardcoded into their system that those without verification cannot even access support. The help centre, was my natural next port of call. As you can guess this leads absolutely nowhere and offers no help for you to get in contact with a human who can fix my issue in 2 seconds. As a last resort you then reach out to their email support. I think amazing .. this is accompanied by a proud banner stating that the \"email customer service responds to all enquiries within 12 hours\", wow what a saving grace. I gladly write up my polite, easy to read email explaining the issue and a few hours later I'm met with the following message: \"Hi there, Thank you for reaching out to us about this issue. We understand you tried to open a Seller profile on Fiverr, and received our response explaining your request wasn't approved. You're welcome to continue using Fiverr as a buyer. If there is anything else we can help you with, please let us know.\" Now by this point, I am not a happy bunny. I go off and find multiple threads from over a whole year ago echoing my exact problem and inability to contact their customer service. So not only are they sending out template responses en masse and claiming to \"respond\" to all email queries, they've been getting away with this for over a whole year!! How has nobody else spotted this and how wrong this is. Any hopeful people reaching out who may need what this site offers more than I will be met with this blanket, ill-thought response. As I said before, I genuinely think this is disgraceful and just pure laziness on their side. This can only be summarised as a systematic approach to frustrate the consumer enough to call defeat after exhausting the only 3 avenues available, all of which have been cleverly manipulated so as not to be viable at all. If but one person reads this and becomes aware of why their application is going so terribly, then I will be content. Just know if you do, it is not your fault and you are a victim of something which has clearly been orchestrated. Fiverr, shame on you.

The staff are awful and rude and create more problems, if you contact them for help, on the many technical issues that occur all the time they begin to analyse all your marketing and profile text. So your original issue or question often gets ignored. Terrible service! There are constantly people emailing you with strange links, demanding to drop your prices and the site always sides with the buyer. Many customers use your service and then dont want to pay, not because you did not provide a good service, but because they know the terrible Fiverr staff are biased against all the sellers. So for a seller, its a complete rip off, as the site staff and customer always are against anyone that tries to make a profit on this awful site. I know dozens of Sellers that are sick and tired of this awful website and its ripping off of the Sellers that work hard all over the world.

I’ve been a customer for years, and only on a few occasions have I come across trustworthy people who actually completed the tasks and met basic quality standards. I've been attempted to be scammed over 5 times on this platform, and in 3 instances, they succeeded. You might think Fiverr has your back, but the truth is their only interest is collecting their commission— they won’t help if you get scammed. Right now, they owe me over £150, and Fiverr refuses to refund it. Instead, they’re offering me credits to use their platform again, so they can make more money off each new order. The worst part: despite me providing proof of the scam and the freelancer admitting to it, Fiverr continues to allow them to operate and offer the same service that defrauds thousands of users daily. Fiverr only cares about taking their cut. They market themselves as intermediaries, but that’s simply not true. They just grab their piece of the pie and become complicit in scams. I’m looking into ways to report this to consumer protection authorities. Be very careful with this platform.

You took away all organic growth on the platform and stuck it behind a paywall. This consequently diminished all my business as well as dropped my account from a lvl 2 account to a lvl 0 account as I couldnt not get enough clients without paying. Moreover, if I did pay, I encumbered these big marketing bills that did not show me the returns I was looking for, if any at all. Second of all, it feels like I am having all these \"growth\" features shoved in my face with the constant inbox messages and paid courses recommended to me to grow my account, along with the other paid features you are now offering. Gone are the days when the platform allowed you to grow your business through your own success; now I am entirely reliant on you. Not related to this either, but 20% of my tips being taken away on top of my orders 20%? Seems like a slap in the face. I understand why this protective feature is implemented from your end but there is really no way you could have innovated this better? Lastly, your support team does nothing other than copy paste FAQ responses and paragraphs from your TOS. It feels like I am talking to an AI, and never getting anywhere with my account issues. They lack communication skills and their copy-and-paste responses make them seem unprofessional and clueless. Sadly in my 7 years here, I cannot recommend Fiverr as a long-term solution to your income. The platform is too volatile and the most important features have been paywalled and changed due to greed. Sure it is great for starting out and earning some money but dont be surprised when you have to start paying for your success instead of earning it.

A New Seller has zero chance to grow on Fiverr only because there are no Buyer Requests option available anymore, with the help of organic marketing there is no future for new sellers. No \"Support\" for Sellers doesn't really matter if you are a new Seller, Level 1, Level 2. You always get the automatic frustrating robot reply. Fiverr was only good for Freelancers untill it had Buyer Request and old features., However, I highly liked the Promoted Gigs option!

Reply from Fiverr Hi there, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review and we'll make sure to forward your feedback to the relevant team. When it comes to how it works, the success score metric evaluates each of your Gigs in key areas related to the order process and your relationship with clients, with the history of each Gig examined to determine a score, relative to other freelancers. Ratings, reviews, and feedback is one of many indicators used, not the only thing. The key areas evaluated include client satisfaction, effective communication, conflict-free orders, order cancellations, delivery time, value for money. To improve the areas with a negative impact, take a look at the tips provided in the article linked below, along with the resources available on your dashboard and by contacting our Support Team. This information provides a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to your success score and how you can evaluate your gig for improvements.

While Fiverr may be suitable for straightforward tasks like graphic design, my experience with a more complex project was disappointing: * Incomplete and Non-Functional Delivery: The delivered product did not meet the agreed-upon specifications and was not operational. * Inappropriate Payment Requests: After the initial payment, the freelancer requested an additional €500 via PayPal, which contravenes Fiverr's terms of service. * Lack of Support: Despite multiple attempts to contact both the freelancer and Fiverr's customer service, I received no adequate assistance or resolution.

It took Fiverr two months to unban my account. This unethical support team canceled my completed orders worth $1,400+. I had spent $29 on Seller Plus at the beginning of the month, but my account was banned, making it unusable. Additionally, I spent $88 to promote my gigs and acquire these orders. After my account was reactivated, neither the funds from my promoted gigs nor the Seller Plus fee were returned to me. I also never received compensation for the canceled orders, which was clearly a scam. I contacted support multiple times, and they admitted that it was Fiverr's mistake. However, they claimed they couldn’t do anything because the scam was carried out by Fiverr officials, not the Fiverr support team. When I repeatedly requested a refund for my promoted gigs, Seller Plus fee, or the funds from canceled orders, they banned my account again. Fiverr should be banned in the United States and fined heavily to prevent other businesses from being scammed. I have seen them carry out similar scams against many others. Ticket Number: Re: 12899129 No response for months. No issues have been resolved. I never got my money back. Instead, they banned my account again. Such a shame!

It provides a fantastic opportunity for freelancers like myself to showcase our skills and connect with clients from all over the world. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to set up a profile, list services, and manage orders. I also enjoyed the diverse range of projects available, which allowed me to work on various design styles and expand my portfolio. Additionally, the rating and review system is a great feature. It not only helps freelancers build credibility but also allows clients to make informed decisions based on previous experiences. I found that positive feedback from clients significantly boosted my confidence and motivated me to deliver high-quality work. On the flip side, one challenge I encountered was the level of competition. With so many talented designers on the platform, it can be difficult to stand out, especially when starting. I believe Fiverr could enhance its support for new sellers by offering more resources or promotional opportunities to help them gain visibility. Another area for improvement is the communication tools. While the messaging system is functional, it could benefit from additional features, such as file sharing capabilities or integrated video calls, to facilitate clearer communication between freelancers and clients. Fiverr excels in providing a global marketplace that connects freelancers with clients seeking specific services. The variety of categories and the ability to customize gigs allow for a tailored experience that meets diverse client needs. The platform's commitment to secure transactions and timely payments is also commendable, as it fosters trust between freelancers and clients. To further enhance the experience for freelancers, Fiverr could consider implementing a mentorship program or community forums where experienced sellers can share tips and advice with newcomers. Additionally, offering more educational resources, such as webinars or tutorials on marketing and branding, could empower freelancers to better promote their services and improve their chances of success. Overall, my experience on Fiverr has been positive, and I appreciate the opportunities it has provided me as a graphic designer. With a few enhancements, I believe it can become an even more valuable platform for freelancers and clients alike.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=81","page_number":81},{"reviewer_name":"Chanaka Fernando","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5c57a18d0fe8837faa6bca28","reviewer_avatar":"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/5c57a18d0fe8837faa6bca28/73x73.png","reviewer_initials":null,"date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"I love that every time Fiverr improves itself to give us many more opportunities.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=81","page_number":81},{"reviewer_name":"Lisa Fasano","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/64cfacc4a0874400125203dc","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"LF","date":null,"star_rating":"2","review_text":"Given the high fees charged by the platform, I expect better.

The platform's algorithm is highly sensitive to response times, and failing to reply to a buyer's message within an hour - regardless of the time of day - can result in a rapid decline in my seller level. Furthermore, Fiverr's AI-driven system makes it difficult to maintain a Level 2 or higher rating, despite my best efforts to deliver high-quality work and ensure buyer satisfaction. What's even more frustrating is that I've consistently received 5-star ratings and wonderful feedback from my clients - not a single complaint. Yet, somehow, I'm still losing my levels all the time. It's disheartening to see my hard work and dedication not being reflected in my Fiverr ratings. As a result, I've decided to shift my focus more and more towards finding new clients directly through my website. By doing so, I can offer them a more personalized experience and greater value. To incentivize this, I'm now offering a discount to clients who place orders directly with me, rather than through Fiverr. The best part? I can now communicate with my clients during normal business hours, without the pressure of responding immediately. And, as it turns out, my clients don't mind at all. They understand that I'm a professional, and they respect my boundaries. This change has been a game-changer for my work-life balance, and I'm excited to build stronger, more meaningful relationships with my clients.\" Reply from Fiverr Hello Sean, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

The freelancer had all 5 star reviews; that I now know we're fake and or coerced. Cons: 1) He didn't start my project until the deadline was near; then sent me a message stating that he was going to close the ticket. But, promised to still assist me with updating my website. 2) I found over ten words misspelled; several words and photos duplicated on the same page. 3) He didn't fix half of the stuff that he said that he would. 4) He's ignored my messages since he received payment and a good review. That he begged me to leave. Once you leave a review and the freelancer responds. You can't change the review. You can request it to be taken down. I requested it to be taken down. I was asked to provide proof, which I did. And still haven't received a response. 5) He was from Pakistan and very hard to understand. Pros: The price was under $300 I'm not a website specialist which is why I chose to hire one. I contacted Wix to see if he did what he was supposed to do. I found out that he didn't. He didn't do the following as advertised: Add 12 products 6 plug ins and extensions Payment processing Opt on form Hosting setup Auto responder integration Social media icons What he did: He uploaded content (3 of 12 images) 😩 Worked on 6 pages Provided a responsive webdesign (which was background colors only). Contacted wix regarding my speed but didn't fix the issue. So now I'm left hiring a real expert. At the same time, I hired an SEO expert who promised to deliver services within a few days. Then changed it to weeks later. I requested to cancel. Then, he told me that he would have it done in four days. Today, he contacted me to advise me that he was almost finished. I reached out to Wix to find out that he lied. I requested an itemization of everything that he did. 👂🏽No response. I also hired a email marketing specialist from Nigeria. He wanted me to create the form that I paid him to create. 😫 These are mainly people from Pakistan or other countries that are con artists! BEWARE OF THE FAKE REVIEWS!! Update: Fiverr contacted Nisar Ali to advise him that I requested a partial refund. He emailed me a nasty message. Five minutes later, I received harassment messages for days on my website, all from individuals from Pakistan, where he's from. I'd never had a visitor from Pakistan. Then, he reported my listings to my webhost. Using Fiverr has been a nightmare!!! Fiverr refunded my money to my Fiverr account, only.

Key issues: Gig Visibility & Spam: New or updated gigs rarely rank, forcing sellers to rely on promotions.

Unfair Payment Delays: Payments are held for arbitrary \"verification\" even after order completion and 5-star reviews. If buyers trust us, why can’t Fiverr? Excessive Fees: A 20% commission on orders is steep, but adding Fiverr Plus ($20/month), promotions, and subscriptions means over 50% of earnings vanish. Worst of all, Fiverr takes 20% from tips—a disrespectful practice no other platform dares to mimic. Seller Support: Called \"partners,\" yet seller feedback is ignored.

The seller are not valued like they should be and with their automatic decrease in the reviews and matrics is becoming more and more frustrating day by day. I have had 36 5 star reviews and 1 bad review and my performance drop to 4.4? What kind of fair platform is this and my recent 2 order scored me 5 star reviews but the rating remain on same level. I have been trying to reach the support team and they take tons of time to response and if they luckily do there is no satisfactory answer.

I'm leaving the platform as they treat their sellers as slaves. They added a Success Score system which could've been great, but they didn't give any guidelines to the sellers how it really works, how were evaluated or how to get better. Buyers are the kings and they're allowed the do backcharges, ask for full refunds without ever speaking with the sellers and lie about their experience to avoid paying. Support doesn't have the seller's back even if you have proof black on white. We're expected to have no life, to respond instantly, to know how to do better when Fiverr doesn't show us the private reviews where clients actually leave an honest review. Also there's no many horrible and rude buyers there and sellers cant leave them a bad review to warn others as then the buyer can retaliate with a bad private review and destroy your earnings for months. One review should not have such a huge weight. I'm paying for Priority support (used to be 2h guaranteed but now its 5) and last time I waited 48h to get a response even after bothering them 3 times on Twitter to look at the ticket....What am I paying for? You want us to be better-Please tell us what to do...give us access to the statistics. I would love to provide a better service but you're not even telling me what to change but you're punishing me. I was Top freelancer....one buyer lied and I provided proof that its a lie and this cut my earnings in half for 3 months...support did nothing about it even that their Terms an Conditions say that Reviews that contain lies will be removed. Fiverr hope you enjoy getting 20% from all those 5$ orders from teen sellers....Professionals who have been paying you hundreds of thousands of dollars in commission are leaving!

They had a scheme where they would ask to talk Google Meet or WhatsApp. And then they do your job at beginning but then ask for money to be paid by Wise or Remitly because Fiver takes %. They kind of held me in check because they wouldn’t ship my stuff. I have to pay for inventory up front, like Auto DS style. This seller took my money and ran. The seller was a VA and did not ship orders out with actual product and tracking codes. I had to refund basically all orders and in process I got account suspended. I repeatedly attempted to talk or call him, he wouldn’t cooperate. I then message him on Fiver about this disturbing situation and he blocks me. I report to Fiver . Long story short, they side with him citing they don’t look at non-Fiver stuff during investigation. I lost my seller account because of this seller and Fiver does not care it seems. I been a loyal buyer on Fiver but no more. I will share this brutal experience to powerful LA media to help educate fellow buyers before they do business with potential scammers. They replied to me Feb 5 2025. It doesn’t help anything I still communicate don the platform and showed them my eBay that their freelancer was hired to handle. I showed them screenshots of my eBay sells where the freelancer scammed me by not having products and tracking number for orders. I don’t know why it’s so hard for them to understand this. I hired the freelancer to do my eBay and they scammed me…. They always reply with “we encourage all users to communicate on platform”. . That is not the issue. I showed proof and evidence that the work was not done correctly and they scammed me. But they decide to back this scammer. Not cool.

Despite maintaining high-quality service, positive reviews, and consistent order completion, my gigs have been unfairly and unreasonably pushed down in search rankings without clear justification.

Additionally, Fiverr's fee deductions feel excessive and disproportionate, especially when they are applied inconsistently. It often feels like sellers are bearing an unfair financial burden without sufficient support or transparency from the platform.

My client gave me a $50 tip and Fiverr took 20%!! I can accept that Fiverr takes 20% of what I charge for my service, but TAKING FROM TIPS THAT MY CLIENTS INTENDED FOR ME FEELS LIKE NOTHING SHORT OF THEFT. It feels greedy, especially since taking 20% just from the regular services of their 3.8 million sellers is, I'm sure, enough to line their pockets and keep their business afloat. I write all of this not to bash Fiverr but because I believe it could be so much better, and if it had a reputation for treating it's sellers fairly, I'm sure they would have way more people who would like to use it. Do better Fiverr. Some things are sacred. Example: You're at a restaurant. Your waitress was incredibly nice and did a great job, so you give her a $20 dollar tip and then all of a sudden you watch as her boss walks up to her, snatches the Andrew Jackson right out of her hands and pockets four of it. You would be absolutely livid if this happened. It would make a scene. This is what I'm talking about. Fiverr: Treat your sellers with respect and give us our tips. We earned them by doing a good job. If WE do a good job, it boosts YOUR reputation. If you steal MY tips it makes ME not want work with you anymore. It's just bad business. DO BETTER.

These people are the reason why the world is broken. Don't dare question or criticise ... if you do then you will never be seen. If you want to be seen you need to make it to a seller level which allows to get into seller plus ( paid program once upon a time was for free ) however I believe it has been made possible for all to pay now. Essentially you pay them to promote and make you visible....for almost 50 $ a month... on top of that if you really want traction you should promote your gigs and pay for clicks..cap 3$ per click.. Oh if you get the work.... fiver has now gone from taking 20% commission to 31% commission. SO you know things must be bad if they are living off the promoted clicks, fees and programs.... ( and there is ALWAYS some new webinar, update or cuddle room talk about how to be a better worker. ) if you are smart like some of us.... you understood that the algorithm is super SEO/ backlinks and keyword based..for mastering this...they forced you to stop and blamed you for jacking the system.... those getting caught being smarter would get warnings and maybe even they would block your account from being found.... remind you of anything else the world has know as of late?? But that is not all. My Final straw was the updated Video on my main gig page ( taking off the holiday promotion stuff from the Christmas season and putting back just finished work) this was changed out in the first week of Jan 2025. After a week of nothing... I wanted to write as per usual to ask if someone could follow up and get on it.... Now, I have discovered there is no way to write customer service you get sent to a chat bot... A bot which offers blog/community post answers.... So.... this is the problem with fiverr.... it is always your fault and their answer \"we can not control anything!\" ( the lie is, they control everything ) especially if you want something from them. I put up with this way of working for many years while there was very good work to be won.... and If you find that work those clients are happy to pay the standard fees. So all that talk about dumping down the business has some truth but it does not have to be that way. Just to be a bit fair ..... The fish always rots from the head down.... so Who runs Fiverr? I will leave that to you to figure out. Enough with the control and manipulation via GUILT. \"Awwww we see your ratings have dropped come on! we know you can do it ! ; ) get back on making us more money !!! \" who gets worse at their job? .... most people who work hard, are customer, service and quality minded will never just start slacking off. So if they are not focused on you they blame you for just not being good enough. Bad style, poor management ... sick methods. Like a really bad Insurance company who blames you for not caring if you don't upgrade your coverage telling you to do it for the sake of your loved ones!\" and then blaming you... if you opt out If you are new and want to learn... go learn... but once you get your p's and q's in line bolt and focus on serving your local clients it really is the most wholesome way to work. How about those SUPER BOWL ADS ?......wooo wooo ! PS as you will see.... fiverr responded to this post and I ask..... did fiverr even read what I wrote, did they address my issues.... NO. Pointed out where the Seller could get info with webinars and blogs and an email ...... a paying customer deserves more than this. But no one forced me I was given a choice...... To feed the Beast.

Unfortunately, my account was recently restricted, and despite submitting eight appeals, Fiverr's customer support team has outright refused to restore it. The restriction stemmed from a minor issue: I used a display name to request an authority letter from a client, which was not intended to violate Fiverr's terms of service. I’ve provided explanations and demonstrated my willingness to comply with their policies, yet every appeal has been rejected without any detailed or constructive feedback. What’s most disheartening is the lack of transparency and empathy in their handling of this matter. I understand the importance of maintaining platform security and policies, but I expected fair treatment and open communication—especially after investing so much time and effort into building my profile and reputation on Fiverr. Fiverr’s inflexible and dismissive approach to resolving issues makes it clear that they prioritize rigid enforcement over supporting their freelance community. I’m disappointed and would caution others to consider this before relying on Fiverr as their primary platform for freelancing. I hope Fiverr improves its customer support processes and adopts a more understanding and case-by-case approach to handling disputes in the future.

Lately, I decided to start referring third-party clients to the platform to build up my profile. A few days ago, I landed a new client and got them to join Fiverr. I sent the client a proposal and when the client logged in Fiverr to accept it, they got their account disabled for no reason whatsoever. I opened a support ticket 5 days ago to find out why, but have received no answer. I even sent an email to Fiverr's CEO but haven't heard a single word. I also read Fiverr's TOS and found absolutely nothing that would justify an account suspension. The platform seems to be neglected. A previous support ticket I'd opened months ago is still unresolved and the replies I kept receiving from the representatives were copy-paste and completely irrelevant to the issue at hand. Going for Upwork or another competitor seems like the best course of action here. Fiverr's overall behavior towards both freelancers and potential buyers is despicable.

I was a very happy and successful seller from 2019-2021 with a level 2 badge seller, it was a dream, however, when I had a break for a year or so and came back in 2022/2024 I had literary no interests (maybe 3 projects). My Gigs were providing professional product photography for Amazon, so not a dying service. I have done everything possible to get the traffic back and improve my Gigs. Changed the gig titles, changed the pricing, put different services on, refined the text and wording, put more examples of finished projects, contacted old clients, put the animation video as an intro, you name it! Everything that was suggested to improve the gig. In time my rating diminished to \"Level 0\"! When I got the client, I was hopeful, but the client rated my service as 4.3 which put me even more down the list!! I have invested a lot of time, money and effort to revive my Gigs but nothing has worked. So sad about this fact. I have lost interest and hope in this platform. On a positive note, the customer service was quick and always helpful resolving project issues quickly and efficiently. Reply from Fiverr Hi Kamila, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We completely understand how important it is to get your Gigs noticed on our platform, and we truly appreciate the effort you've put in. To help attract new buyers, we recommend promoting your Gigs on social media as well.

We're sorry to hear about your experience and please rest assured that we'll forward your comments to the relevant team. When it comes to how it works, the success score metric evaluates each of your Gigs in key areas related to the order process and your relationship with clients, with the history of each Gig examined to determine a score, relative to other freelancers. Ratings, reviews, and feedback is one of many indicators used, not the only thing. The key areas evaluated include client satisfaction, effective communication, conflict-free orders, order cancellations, delivery time, value for money. To improve the areas with a negative impact, take a look at the tips provided in the article linked below, along with the resources available on your dashboard and by contacting our Support Team. This information provides a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to your success score and how you can evaluate your gig for improvements.

While the platform prioritizes clients, it often neglects the interests and fairness towards sellers. Unfortunately, there are instances where scammers and dishonest clients take advantage of this bias. They cancel orders without valid reasons, report sellers unjustly, and Fiverr takes their side without conducting a proper investigation. I dedicated two years to building my reputation and delivering quality work on Fiverr. However, a recent experience with a client completely shattered my trust in the platform. The client received far more than what they had initially agreed to when placing the order. When I politely refused to do additional work that was outside the scope of the original requirements, they retaliated. I believe they reported my account maliciously, and Fiverr responded by banning my account without providing any clear explanation or opportunity for me to defend myself. This experience has been devastating. All the hard work, dedication, and effort I put into growing my business on Fiverr were ruined in a matter of days. What’s worse is that the client in question was a Fiverr-selected client, and it seems their word was taken as the ultimate truth without any verification or investigation from my side. Fiverr's approach in such situations is deeply unfair to sellers. Instead of fostering a balanced and supportive environment for both clients and sellers, they have created a system that leaves sellers vulnerable to exploitation and false accusations.

Fiverr management has no respect for outside designers, whose works are being used to decorate fiverists profiles and even more - they sell them and write a lie stories of how they \"designed\" this and that! At first, I was dealing with them as normal-sending in a complaint or DMCA but then, to my surprise Fiverr management decided that this is a brilliant idea to ask me whether i am a copyright owner. I mean, what the heck? Ain' t it enough that i provide my original artboard, with a timestamp on it and online visible fact that the design was sold to my client ( rights transferred ), why do i have to humiliate myself further and prove i designed it? Yes, i am no longer a rights owner, yet, that does not give Fiverr rights to shamelessly build their reputation by using me as a mule! People, be extremely careful with what you purchase and perform a Google image reverse check, as well as partial art elements check before you purchase anything or even better, run from there as far as you can! Don' t be fooled, they even promote to Pros those who use someone' s else' s art to derive theirs. Clients may not notice that, but professionals like myself instantly recognize the derived bits as i deal with stock, Ai generators and crowdsourcing platforms on a daily basis! As long as Fiverr will just shovel money and will not give a damn about designers, this is the last place to go for a genuine art! I did not place a date properly, as this is an ongoing issue for years! And NOTHING has been done so far to initiate designer fleet portfolio checks and remove the scammers. They just quietly remove reported gigs. The worst stealing case i experienced so far - was when Google reverse image check has shown me 12 results of the exact same design, stolen from my colleagues folio and eleven ( !!! ) of these results led me to Fiverr where all of these eleven gob***its ( excuse my French ) were claiming they designed it! Dear Fiverr, knowing that you will read this - i have a question - how long you will be doing nothing? If you are not capable to clean the designer fleet from scammers, hire me! Because of your scammers, i had to become a design detective. In one year i will get rid of all thieves you have hosted so far. It appears i am better than you in this. Want an example? Here it is: user : turhan_ideas i recently reported. Eight stolen designs ( so far checked ) from me and my colleagues! One of which has been sold on Fiverr! Sold, despite the fact, that it was stolen from a contest winner, which means, it has been sold before already! Now, check the user Hwp6j86nso F ( with 71 google match of her profile pic! ) - the exact same design in her folio! So tell me please, what your customers should think and what exactly is your part of duties and responsibilities in respecting copyright laws? Or you find yourselves somewhat higher than copyright laws are? Why our work is being used for your SEO purposes and why we have to face the ugliness of the situation in finding our designs in the first search page with a little mark under it \"view 12 results\" , where Fiverr thieves are listed as #1 and us, our folios somewhere, on the bottom?

As a seller, well....it is a PITA. Fiverr takes a HUGE chunk of your pay. One of my best sellers is $75 to which Fiverr takes $15 from every sale. Then, if you make a lot of sales fast (say every time I get 3 or more in a week), once they are delivered, Fiverr likes to freeze and review my account. It has been like this for around 5 years. The holidays are always busy times for me. After 22 sales and all positive reviews in a 2 weeks span, my account is being reviewed.....again. They do this in attempts to take my earnings. The biggest scam on Fiverr is Fiverr itself. Edit: as I am now being flooded with emails requesting more information.....NO. No I will not include my name and email associated with my fiverr account. That's like asking me to just step on a chopping block so they can close my account out of spite. NO. Fiverr knows this is common behavior on their part and they do not need extra personal information to look into my review. What would I gain leaving this review other than exposing the poor quality of service from the fiverr platform? I will not provide more \"personal\" information. What I will do is continue to update this review each time they flag my account after sale.

There was also an option to buy additional services. I selected additional services and then approved payment for the initial work.

He contacted me to provide a trading bot service but immediately violated Fiverr’s policies by asking me to move our conversation to Telegram. On Telegram, he demanded additional payments in cryptocurrency (USDT), promising to deliver a high-quality trading bot. After making payments, he completely failed to deliver the promised work and continued making excuses to avoid responsibility. This seller operates unethically, violating both Fiverr’s policies and basic professional standards. I have reported him to Fiverr and Telegram for fraudulent activity.

All of sudden i logged out from the site. I tried to log in again using the same google email the last 8 years and it said i dont have account and i can create account. I emailed fiverr and the response was that i do not have account that email. I explained i did for 8 years! And i gave them my username. They say it does not match. I explained This is site issue or System failure or something. Dont tell me i dont have account with that email. I dont have another email, i had same email for over 10 years and i used it to log in. So either someone hacked my account and changed email or system failure removed my email. And the crazy part is have over 90$ in my account. Is this fiver way to delete my account and steal my money? I really believe so because they lying and saying i dont have account with the email and never did. So now no help from them.

Ratings, reviews, and feedback is one of many indicators used, not the only thing. The key areas evaluated include client satisfaction, effective communication, conflict-free orders, order cancellations, delivery time, value for money.

It's difficult to get hired if you're not already established. Also, I've had errors with the system where I haven't been emailed when a new client messages me on Fiverr. Meanwhile, if you miss a message or take too long to respond, it increases your response time, which makes you look bad as a seller. But if you don't have anyone contact you for weeks at a time, you stop looking at it daily. Then, if the system doesn't email you about a new message, you're hosed. The system also seems to punish you if you take a vacation and shut your gigs off for a week--it seems to make it so you don't get new business as easily. The other drawback is that, at least so far (2 years in), I've had to work for far, far less than I'm worth. Then they take 20% from the seller and some percentage (5%, I think) from the buyer. So they're get a huge, greedy cut. Ten percent would be reasonable, in my opinion. Twenty percent is greedy, especially when they're also collecting an additional percentage from your clients. Additionally, they hold on to your money for two weeks, so they get two weeks of interest on every payment made, which earns them even more money. So they make money hand over fist, while you make pennies. On the positive end, it's easy to withdraw your money and see your earnings. You're also guaranteed to get paid for your work--it's set up so clients can't stiff you. So that's good. Overall, it's good if you really need some extra cash. You'll make some here and there. But if you have other money-making alternatives, those options may be better. Note that I'm using a different email address for this review than I use for Fiverr because I don't want Fiverr to punish me for it.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=90","page_number":90},{"reviewer_name":"JamesB","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/56803ac20000ff0001f7402d","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"JA","date":null,"star_rating":"2","review_text":"It is hit and miss with this platform.

We understand that you are concerned about your Success score as it is 6. Please know that this metric evaluates each of your Gigs in key areas related to the order process and your relationship with clients, with the history of each Gig examined to determine a score, relative to other freelancers. Ratings, reviews, and feedback is one of many indicators used, not the only thing. The key areas evaluated include client satisfaction, effective communication, conflict-free orders, order cancellations, delivery time, value for money. To improve the areas with a negative impact, take a look at the tips provided in the article linked below, along with the resources available on your dashboard and by contacting our Support Team. This information provides a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to your success score and how you can evaluate your gig for improvements.

I completed an order on January 21, 2024, and the customer disputed it on April 24, 2024—three months later—using unreasonable excuses. I delivered the work as per the requirements, and every time I submitted a delivery, the customer would add new requests and revisions. I went above and beyond by implementing every additional request over a span of four months. However, when I finally refused to make further changes that were beyond the original scope, the customer opened a dispute. Despite having the latest version of the work, they managed to get the code for free, as Fiverr sided with them without thoroughly addressing my concerns. This is extremely unfair to me as a seller who worked diligently and fulfilled the original requirements. Fiverr's lack of support in this situation is deeply disheartening and undermines the trust of sellers who contribute to the platform. Reply from Fiverr Hi there, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We can certainly imagine how upsetting a cancellation can be. When a buyer requests a cancellation, we carefully review the circumstances surrounding the request and the details of the delivery. We fully understand and appreciate the time and effort freelancers invest in each order, which is why we take great care in evaluating all aspects before making a decision. It’s important to maintain clear communication with the buyer and ensure that you have delivered the order as requested, with everything functioning as promised in the Gig description. If you encounter any issues with an order or have questions regarding the cancellation process, please don’t hesitate to reach out to our Support Team at fvrr.co/help. We’ll be happy to review the order and assist you further.

However, as a reputable company that offers services to worldwide clients, they should have implemented fail-safe methods in the first place. Even though they guaranteed my gig wouldn't be affected by this incident, I noticed a considerable loss of orders. Just think for a second about how many times they have made this kind of wrongful denials for other sellers. And don't forget about the fact they lied outright about stating \"Gig denial after careful consideration\" in the email. If they considered carefully, this kind of issue not have happened in the first place. My initial experience: Want to see your hard work ruined by buggy AI? Even though I have had many positive experiences on Fiverr, due to a recent incident, I no longer recommend Fiverr to freelancers. The story is below. I am a YouTube membership badge and emote designer who providing services since 2021. Usually, I revamp my gig images, title, and description at every year's end. So, I did that on yesterday (22/12/2024). But not all, just the title from \"I will design custom youtube membership badges and emotes\" to \"I will draw custom youtube subscriber badges and cute emotes\". Right after I clicked the save button, a notification appeared stating, \"Your gig was denied\" and received an email containing this. \"Unfortunately we had to remove your Gig draw custom youtube subscriber badges and cute emotes due to the following reason/s: We had to remove your Gig as the service you are offering is prohibited by our Community Standards. This decision was made after careful consideration and cannot be undone. For more information please read our Prohibited Services policy in Fiverr’s Community Standards.\". The funny things about this reason are, how did they manage to do a careful consideration in a second after I clicked the Save button, and what type of prohibited services were included in that title? When I reached out to their customer support, they just repeated the same thing and could not restore my gig. As a leading freelancing company, they must have a fail-safe way to revert false positives but in Fiverr, no need. Because they solely rely on AI. Not only that, there is one more buggy AI tool that can ruin your entire profile. The \"Success Score\". Once that starts to go down, it never goes up even if you only receive 5 star reviews daily. Final conclusion, If you want to see your hard work ruined by a company that runs on untested AI algorithms, feel free to be a freelancer on Fiverr. I think I will no longer try to stay as a freelancer on Fiverr. Reply from Fiverr Hi Tharusha, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review and for sharing your experience with us. We will be sure to forward your feedback regarding the Success Score. This metric evaluates each of your Gigs in key areas related to the order process and your relationship with clients, with the history of each Gig examined to determine a score, relative to other freelancers. Ratings, reviews, and feedback is one of many indicators used, not the only thing. The key areas evaluated include client satisfaction, effective communication, conflict-free orders, order cancellations, delivery time, value for money. To improve the areas with a negative impact, take a look at the tips provided in the article linked below, along with the resources available on your dashboard and by contacting our Support Team. This information provides a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to your success score and how you can evaluate your gig for improvements.

Fiverr is truly a great tool for connecting professionals with clients, and I’ve enjoyed being part of this community. However, I recently left a review with fewer stars than I intended, and I wanted to take this opportunity to clarify my feedback. I am a professional audio engineer specializing in mixing and mastering with many years of experience. I’ve worked with record labels and have a proven track record, including 33 total reviews on Fiverr—all of which are 5 stars. My clients consistently love the work I deliver. However, my challenge on Fiverr has been visibility. Despite meeting all the recommended steps—creating a video presentation, optimizing my gigs, and maintaining exceptional reviews—I have not received a single client organically from Fiverr’s platform. Every client I’ve serviced through Fiverr has been someone I introduced to the platform myself. I believe a large part of this is due to the lack of an option to apply for Fiverr Pro. As a seasoned professional in my field, becoming a Fiverr Pro would help me stand out to the right audience who values quality and expertise over low prices. It’s difficult to compete with lower-cost gigs when I charge fair rates that reflect my experience and the high standard of my work. I hope Fiverr considers providing more opportunities for exposure for professionals like me, especially those with stellar reviews and proven experience. I truly believe Fiverr has the potential to connect me with new clients who value professional-grade services, but at the moment, it feels like my gigs are not being seen. Thank you for taking the time to read this feedback. I love Fiverr and believe it can be even better with these improvements.

Issue #1: The \"Success Score\" system is total BS. It’s been around for over a year, and it measures nothing of real value. Supposedly, it’s there to reflect performance, but in reality, it’s just random statistics that have no connection to your skills or client satisfaction. For example, I’ve completed 40 orders on this platform (in four freaking years), all with 5-star ratings and inspiring reviews. Most of my clients are repeat customers who even leave tips. I’ve never had a single complaint. Yet somehow, my Success Score keeps dropping, no matter what I do. It’s infuriating and adds unnecessary stress on top of an already stressful musician's life. Fiverr must fix this system and remove the useless factors dragging it down—like “effective communication.” How the hell do you even measure that? By keywords? All my communication is effective if the order is finished with satisfaction on both sides! Pure idiocy—and that’s just one example of the system’s flaws. Issue #2: The fees are daylight robbery. Fiverr takes 20% from every single order, including tips. On top of that, they push a \"Pro Subscription\" just so you can withdraw your money in a week instead of two. Are you kidding me? If I’m already paying that much, shouldn’t these basic features be included? At the very least, they could compensate by offering a lower fee for subscribers. Fiverr is built on the hard work of sellers, yet they keep squeezing us dry with absurd fees and rules. Considering how many sellers they have, a 10% fee would be more than enough to sustain the platform. But no—they’d rather profit from doing nothing but nonsense while we stress over their ridiculous business model. At this point, Fiverr doesn’t feel like a freelance platform—it feels like exploitation. They need to wake up and realize who’s keeping their platform alive: the sellers. 1 star for at least bringing some customers my way. Another star for the courage to ask for a Trustpilot review, hoping that someone there genuinely cares about seller feedback and it’s not just another promo stunt. The near future will tell...

While, I say it again, everybody was satisfied. No order was never cancelled. My prices were low too (nothing was left after all the fees and taxes!!!). They just want us to work always harder, for the lowest prices possible.} When I wanted to discuss it with their team I saw that we only can talk to a chatbot, that \"will eventually redirect your request to a real person\" (which was not my case!)

Not to mention they take 20% of commission, on YOUR prices (including on tips!!) Update : you think you're done with the fees once the 20% are given to Fiverr ? Absolutely not!! I wanted to withdraw my money and lost around 6% of all my money AGAIN!! (Just for the conversion dollars to euros I guess, that's theft at this point!!!) And of course you only discover it AFTER you withdraw it, they will always make you believe everything you earned is yours... Reply from Fiverr Hi there, Thank you for taking the time to leave a review and share your thoughts regarding the Success Score metric. We truly appreciate your feedback and will make sure to forward it to the relevant team for consideration. The success score metric evaluates each of your Gigs in key areas related to the order process and your relationship with clients, with the history of each Gig examined to determine a score, relative to other freelancers. Ratings, reviews, and feedback is one of many indicators used, not the only thing. The key areas evaluated include client satisfaction, effective communication, conflict-free orders, order cancellations, delivery time, value for money. To improve the areas with a negative impact, take a look at the tips provided in the article linked below, along with the resources available on your dashboard and by contacting our Support Team. This information provides a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to your success score and how you can evaluate your gig for improvements.

In my particular case, I´m an Ilustrator currently struggling with a nonsensical decline in my success score, which went from 8 to 6 completely out of the blue. I work almost exclusively with the same repeat clients, all of which always leave raving reviews and love my work and often work with me, and have never had any order cancelations or negative reviews. Upon contacting support and inquiring about this, they simply told me that the reason my score dropped is because for some reason, your score is also determined by the score of other sellers, as Fiverr will compare your services and prices to other sellers and either raise or lower your success according to it. The problem is that when you´re an illustrator like me, that metric doesn´t make sense nor can it ever be used in an effective way, because no art is equal and prices will always vary in order to account for things such as how long a piece takes to make, how detailed it is or how big is the project. For someone like me who mostly does detailed illustrations that takes days to paint, it absolutely doesn´t make sense to compare me to someone who does simpler and cheaper services because even if we are in a similar industries, our services and prices will not always be the same. This is the equivalent of trying to compare McDonalds to Pizza Hut solely on the basis that they are both fast-food chains and completely ignore everything else, including how different their services and products are. Considering the fact that the website also charges really aggressive fees on your work AND that it takes 14 days for the deducted payment to go through, it often feels as though the website goes out of its way to prevent sellers from growing on their platform. I don´t understand how this is effective or even a proper, accurate calculation of someone´s hard work on the platform when it is really evident that despite having had over 30 orders with 5 star reviews on my profile and stellar comments about my professionalism, communication and hard work, the website chooses to ignore all of that and instead use nonsensical metrics that do not in any way, shape or form reflect how dedicated a seller is on the platform.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=95","page_number":95},{"reviewer_name":"MansoorAhmed Satti","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5f3f9e9ae456be633b220bb3","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"MS","date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"Keeping the faith and hustling.

Initially, it worked reasonably well for the first few months. I soon began noticing issues with their grading system for freelancers, such as the \"success score\" and similar metrics that are supposed to remain relatively stable. These scores, meant to be stable according to their docs, I have seen them dropping by 6 points (out of 10) within just a few days, often without any apparent reason—even though my rating remains a consistent 5 stars out of 5. Low scores means less options to get a gig. While customer support is speedy and efficient with certain very small tasks, like replying to inquiries the same that the documentation already says or handling minor issues, they fall short when addressing more significant problems. For instance, they seem unable or unwilling to intervene with unreasonably demanding clients or buyers. Instead, their responses often repeat what’s already in the documentation, offering little help for anything beyond the very, very basics. Edit: see their response as a perfect instance of the problem regarding working with Fiverr. They imply one don't know how to work with their system, instead of understanding the criticism that their crooked ratings is what's harming good freelances and putting freelances with shadow practices on top. This means unsatisfied clients, bad deliveries, and a bad experiences for freelances as well. Which is bad for everyone except (for now) for Fiverr's fee, but will harm their fees in the long run as well.

We need more seller protection . secondly the \"success score\" is hated by most sellers , it doesnt even make sense and alot of us want it gone /reverted back to the old state . lastly please add more payout methods specifically for African countries . Would love to see it be mandatory for buyers to review as well ,alot of the time they buy and dont rate and then we as sellers cant pester them to do so . overally a poor freelancing application for sellers since we are not really cared about .

Regarding the Success Score, this metric evaluates each of your Gigs in key areas related to the order process and your relationship with clients, with the history of each Gig examined to determine a score, relative to other freelancers. Ratings, reviews, and feedback is one of many indicators used, not the only thing. The key areas evaluated include client satisfaction, effective communication, conflict-free orders, order cancellations, delivery time, value for money. We'll make sure to forward your feedback about adding more payment methods to the relevant team for updates in the future.

I meet all of the qualifications to become Fiverr Pro certified and yet I’m still just a standard seller despite attempting to apply several times. Services like Fiverr devalue services even further than things like art, music, etc have already been devalued. I have been a seller on this platform for a while now with 32 - 5 star reviews and the quality of work has yet to improve. The Fiverr business model is rooted in unethical work practices that must be covered by loopholes in work laws (speculation). I wanted this to be a good platform for so many reasons, but time and time again Fiverr has let me down. I’ve subscribed to their seller plus program and bought courses as well to no avail in any actual improvements. Fiverr randomly stripped me of my Level One seller status for simply cancelling one order that didn’t match the description of the gig I was offering. I pretty much had to nag them until they gave me my level one status back. These are just a couple examples, not to mention the countless times buyers refuse to mark orders as complete or imply giving you a negative review until you give them things that are far outside of what they paid for. Fiverr if you’re reading this, work with me to actually address my concerns and prove to me that your platform isn’t a predatory place for freelance individuals to be undersold. I’ll take this review down once that happens and I’ll follow it up with an updated and appreciative one. Until then, this is 100% how I feel and as someone who has made a living doing what I do outside of Fiverr for nearly 10 years now, I can assure you that the problem isn’t me.

When it comes to how it works, the success score metric evaluates each of your Gigs in key areas related to the order process and your relationship with clients, with the history of each Gig examined to determine a score, relative to other freelancers. Ratings, reviews, and feedback is one of many indicators used, not the only thing. The key areas evaluated include client satisfaction, effective communication, conflict-free orders, order cancellations, delivery time, value for money.

When it started out, the base fee for every service was $5 and the seller earned $4. As the option to sell at higher rates became available to higher-ranked and more experienced sellers, the earning rate of 80% remained the same. However, today on the system the base rate is listed at $5 but the site also tacks on an additional $2 free making it $7. But does the seller see any of that fee, no. And Fiverr even takes a cut of any tips you might get. There are many more sellers, which can be a good thing. But fewer and fewer sellers offer affordable options which was kind of the whole point of Fiverr. The site is very strict when it comes to formatting a new gig and the rating algorithm is extremely flawed in terms of inaccurately reflecting your performance. Overall, the site is still good for the most part but not in class of what it used to be from the seller side.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=98","page_number":98},{"reviewer_name":"Mayra","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/676828e5a72ae4d65b246203","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"MA","date":null,"star_rating":"3","review_text":"Everyday at any hour i receive a lot of message of people from india (Probably 20 messsge per day) and 100% of this messages are not related to any Fiverr services, and because the hour differences i cant response inmediatly and that afect my rate on Fiverr, its really unconfortable","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=98","page_number":98},{"reviewer_name":"Sathika Wijerathna","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5e399aa0616781ac558f257f","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"SW","date":null,"star_rating":"5","review_text":"Great website for freelancers and nice place to find a good freelancing service for any kind of project, new ideas, digital services, logo design, logo animations, web development, app development, animations, video editing, photo enditing, 3D modeling, and more and more lots of services are there.

Client Approached me to refactor all the code to the latest apple guid lines and push the build to App Store Connect Test Flight. i did the order and fixed the code and show them a video document first in chat that i have successfully refactored the code to support latest swift 6 and xcode 16.1 compatible and app was running fine in simulator, customer was happy we created the order and i asked the client to provide the Apple developer account credentials but due to the reason of confidentiality most of the clients tend not to share their developer account credentials instead they will ask my developer account email so that they can add me into the apple developer team so that i can sign and push the build to test flight as client informed me that they have the app already on the app store connect i just have to push the new build which i did, and upon successfully uploading the build to test flight the client said he is not able to download the app from test flight on his mobile phone but he did receive and see the new build but not able to install upon investigating i find out the app was removed by apple and this app can not be used to test and publish new builds i informed the client about this and it would require me extra work to create a new app with new bundle and then change the bundle of our fixed code app to new bundle and then upload the build to the new app which i did with the clients relative as client informed in the meeting on Fiverr that i will be receiving the message on Fiverr by a client named \"Sarah\" who is the real owner of the app. our order is concluded at this point with the first client \"Chturn\" that i already have fixed the code and pushed the build to test flight that was our first order requirements and i submitted the fixed code on the order page and deliver the client with the source code to which client never responded and asked anything else nor accept the order but after some day's i received the notification from Fiverr that the order is completed automatically. meanwhile i received the message from the real owner of the app on fiverr name \"Sarah\" as informed by the first customer. i walked \"Sarah\" from the whole process by sharing my screen in a Fiverr meeting and explained everything as she was happy that i was able to fixe her code and the app was building and running fine at this point also i find some UI related issues in the app as i was going through and i asked \"Sarah\" i'll fix these issues with out any charges as she told me the app is about helping people who need help in quit drinking, but i did charge here for the app store connect new app creation and pushing the build to test flight and also completing the information needed to publish the app on App store. she was happy with my work and even left a tip i think. after some days i received new text from \"Sarah\" that she want the webview inside the app which shows the webpage of her blog posts to not have the web navigation. i informed her that will require a custom implementation of webview to inject a javascript to hide the certain section of the webpage that include the navigation to other pages. she agreed and we had another order and in which i had to fix the navigation bar of the website when opened in mobile app to not show up. i fixed that particular issue and send the video document that the required functionality is done and then i submit the code on order page and i went an extra mile again and push new build to test flight again for free which was not the part of the order. client asked it and i did it for free. after a day client said there is another issue on onboarding screen that she is not able to see anything when tap on to see the privacy policy which i debugged and fixed and send the build to client without any order for free just to have a happy client then she asked to replace some web URL as the client informed she recently had a new website and the links to the old website are not working and i did that also again for free and also went extra mile and pushed the build to test flight not to mention clients numerous requests to add new team members and testers to the app and all that for free just to make a good connection and help the cause. but after completing the order client gave me 3.7 stars on order completion just because i had one meeting rescheduled and accept this rating. meanwhile the first customer after 20 days named \"chturn\" asked me to send the code to his personal email address which i denied and he left me 1 Star with very bad comment which clearly Violates Fiverr TOS. i requested to remove that and reported that to fiverr and its still not resolved.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=98","page_number":98},{"reviewer_name":"jeff

While it aims to reward performance, it often fails to recognize true expertise. Many low-skilled accounts manage to rank and secure clients, while a significant number of highly skilled professionals struggle to get enough visibility, sometimes waiting over six months or more without substantial client interaction. The introduction of the paid promotion system for gigs is a mixed bag. While it can help some freelancers gain visibility, it often comes at a steep cost—sometimes consuming up to 80% of their profit margins. Additionally, the system is inconsistent; while it may generate one or two orders, it frequently targets the wrong audience, resulting in wasted clicks and unproductive expenses. In some cases, the promoted gig fails to attract any meaningful engagement at all. Another major issue is Fiverr Pro. Once a freelancer converts their account to Fiverr Pro, they are permanently locked into that status and cannot revert to a regular account. This limitation can be frustrating for many users. Moreover, tracking and managing a Fiverr Pro account from the mobile app is cumbersome, as the app lacks essential functionalities for effective account management. Finally, Fiverr's customer support system leaves much to be desired. Resolving issues is often a slow and frustrating process, with inadequate responses to freelancer concerns. While Fiverr has potential as a platform, these systemic issues significantly undermine its effectiveness for both new and seasoned freelancers. Improvements in the level system, paid promotion efficiency, account flexibility, and customer support are urgently needed to make Fiverr more equitable and user-friendly. Reply from Fiverr Hi Sharif, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. We'll make sure to forward your feedback regarding the Fiverr Pro feature, the level system and paid promotions. When it comes to how it works, the success score metric evaluates each of your Gigs in key areas related to the order process and your relationship with clients, with the history of each Gig examined to determine a score, relative to other freelancers. Ratings, reviews, and feedback is one of many indicators used, not the only thing. The key areas evaluated include client satisfaction, effective communication, conflict-free orders, order cancellations, delivery time, value for money. We understand how important it is to get your Gigs noticed on our site. If you'd like, you can explore options to purchase promotional features for your Gigs, but please know that there is no pressure to do so. In the meantime, we'd be happy to share a few tips to help you maximize your visibility: 1. Share your Gigs on social media to attract new buyers. 2. Participate in the Fiverr Forum to engage with the community. 3. Regularly update or edit your Gigs to keep them fresh.

If a gig is hourly, and the client makes more than one order in the same order, the total hours are not doubled based on the number of orders, they will remain the same as if they were a single order. This is problematic because you will have to use the tool to extend delivery times. 2. Many times you will have to use the feature to extend delivery times (and not necessarily because it is your fault), but apparently this affects your success score which is important to level up. 3. Fiverr doesn't tell you, but after delivering an order, the client will have the option to make a private review, this review can have a bad impact on your statistics and you would never know. 4.

Fiverr revamped its level system without any prior warning, leaving many of us demoted with no chance to adjust or improve our gigs. This change, combined with the platform’s massive freelancer layoffs, has thrown countless sellers, including myself, into uncertainty. We’ve spent years building our reputations, delivering quality work, and maintaining strong client relationships, only to see all that effort wiped out with no explanation or opportunity for feedback. It feels like Fiverr has forgotten the value of its freelancers, and this sudden shift has left us without work, without support, and without a clear way forward. Fiverr needs to rethink these drastic changes and provide more transparency and communication with its freelancers. Until then, I can’t help but feel that the platform no longer values the very people who made it successful.

The fees are unreasonably high for both parties. But the fees alone aren’t enough for Fiverr—they also take a cut from freelancers’ tips, which is outrageous. And that’s not all. They exploit freelancers further with their “Ads” system. While freelancers can pay to advertise their gigs, they are charged for every click, regardless of whether it leads to a legitimate inquiry. A significant portion of these clicks come from bots that send generic messages like “Hi” or “Hello, I need help.” Even if you respond instantly, they never reply again because they’re bots, as their profiles often make obvious. This is incredibly frustrating. If Fiverr wants to make money, why don’t they advertise random gigs from new freelancers or those with 1–300 reviews? This would give them a fair chance to succeed without losing money on ads plagued by bot traffic. I’ve tested your ad system, and it’s clear bots are involved. I am a freelancer with over 50 five-star reviews. When I contacted your support about this issue, I asked why we need to pay for ads, and your response was along the lines of, “Well, you don’t have to—you can just rely on your existing clients.” Are you serious? Fiverr is blatantly profiting from exploiting its users. The current system is unsustainable. The fees might be acceptable if Fiverr invested in advertising legitimate freelancers without charging them for a flawed ad system filled with bots. By promoting hard-working freelancers with well-maintained profiles and fewer than 300 reviews, Fiverr could earn more and build a healthier marketplace. As it stands, if a freelancer doesn’t already have reviews, they’re unlikely to succeed on Fiverr. I’m saying this as someone who has experienced these issues firsthand. Something needs to change.

We've made sure to forward your feedback about the Success Score to the relevant team. Please know that this metric evaluates each of your Gigs in key areas related to the order process and your relationship with clients, with the history of each Gig examined to determine a score, relative to other freelancers. Ratings, reviews, and feedback is one of many indicators used, not the only thing. The key areas evaluated include client satisfaction, effective communication, conflict-free orders, order cancellations, delivery time, value for money. To improve the areas with a negative impact, take a look at the tips provided in the article linked below, along with the resources available on your dashboard and by contacting our Support Team. This information provides a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to your success score and how you can evaluate your gig for improvements.

Don't get me wrong but I believe that to maintain its quality standards, it keeps the platform hard for level 0, 1 and 2 sellers. Only the Pro and Top Rated ones get to enjoy big clients. I've rarely found high paying clients on Fiverr (mostly SMBs who don't have a lot to spend). Other platforms have longer and higher paying contracts in comparison. And not having an hourly contract option at level 2 also sucks!","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=100","page_number":100},{"reviewer_name":"fdesigned","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6767f3c8ee9117ef51125314","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"FD","date":null,"star_rating":"3","review_text":"Please make again fiverr proposal from customer so we as seller can pitch the project","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=100","page_number":100},{"reviewer_name":"Daniyal CH","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6767f37fee9117bcad1252f2","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"DC","date":null,"star_rating":"3","review_text":"I had an issue with a client and fiver response felt biased and one sided.

Whatever problem you encountered - look up your problem in the FAQ, you're on your own. But getting those amount of money isn't enough, they introduced gigs promotions. Now it's useless to have gigs without paying for promotions, because nobody ever will get it discovered. If you want your gig to show up somewhere not on 101 page, pay for it. They don't value freelancers: they are able to leave a client review only if client left their own review. Now if client don't play nice, and never left a review, there is no way to share how was your experience working with him. They also segregate freelancers based on hideous \"success\" score, and despite all my dozens of orders are perfect 5 starts, the \"success\" score isn't moving anywhere. If I'm not successful with my performance, then who does? There is no official description about how it's calculated, so it all comes down to if fiverr likes you or not. The platform is buggy, or have limited functionality otherwise. They are here to collect money in a greedy way.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=100","page_number":100},{"reviewer_name":"Nick Wilcox","reviewer_link":"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/634e44806d28400014f631b3","reviewer_avatar":null,"reviewer_initials":"NW","date":null,"star_rating":"3","review_text":"I like the platform overall. It has afforded me a FREE way to support my freelance business and it can generachangete leads for me 24/7. The app (both web and native) have early to use screens and functions. They only get paid when I do - which is a refreshing change of pace from subscription models. The only dislike I have is the Success Score. The score is one of six metrics used by FIVERR to give you an overall level. Even though I have all 5.0 star reviews, never had an unhappy client, or had to cancel/refund an order, my Success Score is dropping. Putting sellers against other sellers is wrong and unfair to smaller accounts like mine (and others trying to grow) who don't have big marketing budgets. Please consider changing the Success Score to be skill based.

And let's be honest, if freelancers pay Fiverr directly by purchasing a \"premium\" account, they get much more clients and are positioned even better, which is very bad for clients because sometimes they get poor quality for a higher price this way. Very poor IT quality of the portal, straight from the Internet from the 1990s. Very strong audio and video compression of demo videos, which changes their quality beyond recognition. You can see very low cost cutting in a multi-million dollar company to just save some space on servers. Inability to move your demos in the gallery and manipulate them freely. Reply from Fiverr Hi Pan, Thanks for taking the time to leave a review and we'll make to forward your feedback to the relevant team. Freelancers have the option to purchase the Promoted Gig feature or they can also promote their Gigs social media on their behalf. We also recommend to update Gigs periodically and to take part in to Fiverr Forum. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us at fvrr.co/help. We’re here to help!

This way, those who understand the project can easily offer their services to clients. The gig promotion and ads system on Fiverr is a bit challenging because after payment deductions, sellers don’t get much in savings. If the promotion isn’t run, the percentage also decreases. In my opinion, Fiverr should be more beneficial for sellers, as they invest their time and hard work, and often struggle to make ends meet. Sellers may only receive 1 or 2 orders a month, and that too after running ads. Fiverr should improve its system and rates to better support sellers.","useful_count":"0","source_url":"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com?page=100","page_number":100}]
